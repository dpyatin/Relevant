"I should make myself clear, I think? I dont go into films with such severe expectations like Gatsby all the time. Very rarely. The last time I did was with Spring Breakers, because I was determined to love it. And I did. It exceeded my expectations and so did Gatsby, but in a different way. I know there are people who go into films completely blind, and good for them, but if someone out of the majority denies ever having had some preconception or expectation of how a film will be, they are probably lying. Pretty much, if youve ever watched a trailer (as misleading as they are) and entertained the idea of seeing the film or not seeing the film based on that trailer, youve made a split second judgment. (Woo, Blink!) Im certainly not advocating such behavior, I was just saying that it happens to me sometimes.   Yes, expectations and hope are different things, but, the latter is a transmutation and form of the former, if unconsciously so.   Anyways, just thought I might clear that up.","odditiesoflife:  The Real Abandoned Overlook Hotel  Unlike the fictional Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubricks The Shining, this hotel is really named the Overlook.

There are rumors that the hotel is haunted. According to urban explorers who frequent the spooky site, cameras malfunction, sounds can be heard throughout the premises and items seem to move around the hotel by themselves.","film-dot-com:  THE ART HOUSE: WELCOME TO THE SILVER SCREEN SOCIETY  In the closing months of 2010, Adam Hanson, Trevor Basset and myself started throwing around ideas for a project that we could collaborate on. We were all looking for something to do in our off time, and that lead to emails being passed between the three of us over what we could build that would force us to create new work on a consistent basis. People start group projects all the time, much of them with the intent of being a vehicle for self-promotion and traffic. All we wanted was a way to keep ourselves accountable for designing new pieces in our spare time regularly. Promises are harder to break and laziness is a more difficult rhythm to fall into when you commit to people you know; doubly so when your plan expands to include relative strangers in the festivities. We wanted others to join us, which meant that flaking out became harder: when you ask other designers, illustrators, and artists to use their free time on something that doesnt offer much of a reward outside of creative fulfillment, it helps if youre in the trenches with them.  We decided to model the project around a book club, with film filling the role of the novel instead. Well in advance, wed reach out out to other creatives with an assigned film for each month, giving people time to watch, digest, and create. When the scheduled month would roll around, pieces would start being uploaded at the end of the first week and would continue until the calendar changed and we moved forward. That was the plan. Wed all reach out to people, maintain the site, and participate with our own images. And every month wed alternate amongst ourselves who would chose what film so that we all had a say in what wed be tackling.  Silver Screen Society launched on February 4, 2011 with Danny Boyles 28 Days Later leading the way. Over two years, several hundreds of artists, and a large serving of films later, the site is still moving along. Adam left in June 2011 because of an increasingly busy schedule, so Trevor and I have been steering the ship since, trying to keep the idea fresh while learning from mistakes made along the way.

I know, I know, its like Im breaking a code of ethics for film buffs or film critics. This happens for a couple of reasons: a) I dont get out that often, so I have to be deliberately selective of what I see (I only seen 12-20 theatrical releases a year), and I often choose what I think Im going to enjoy the most, or at least what Im going to get the most out of; or b) I have had strong reactions from the directors previous work (or screenwriter or actor, but usually director). Case in point, I went in to The Great Gatsby with as closed of a mind as you could probably get. I was going to hate watch it, essentially. I was more than ready to detest whatever Lurhmann had done to bastardize F. Scott Fitzgeralds text. Again, this sound completely horrible, but, so be it. I was, however, in for a couple surprises. But, I guess the most surprising thing about Gatsby is I didnt hate it.

The human female is a curious creature; like our close great ape cousins, but unlike almost all other mammals, they build up a thick barrier in the uterine wall, to protect against any potential embryo that might implant itself. When theres no embryo implantation, the thickened wall is shed, in the process known as menstruation.  The thing is, most mammals dont menstruate. They go into heat, and occasionally shed uterine lining (if the uterus is scratched, or an egg tries to implant but fails, for example), but theres no regular cycle of bloody discharge relating to breeding. This is because other mammals go through triggered decidualization (developing a uterine lining only when a fertilized egg begins to implant itself), while the great apes (and a couple other convergently evolved families, including bats) experience spontaneous decidualization, where they develop a thick uterine lining during every ovulation, before an egg can even attempt to implant itself.  Why the different linings? Well, it turns out that there are three types of mammal placentas (remember, placentas are developed by the embryo/fetus, not the mother):  Epitheliochordal, which is completely superficial, and does not connect in any significant way to the mothers body. The endometrial epithelium, connective tissue, and uterine epithelium are all preserved and undisturbed in the mother. The fetus is separated from the mother by three layers of tissue. Nutrients and waste are delivered and eliminated through diffusion, rather than direct connection. This group includes equids, swine, and ruminants. Endotheliochordal, which is slightly more invasive to the mother, only preserves the uterine epithelium. Nutrients and waste are not exchanged through direct connection to the mother, but the placenta only leaves one layer of tissue between it and the mother. This group includes cats and dogs. Hemochorial is the most invasive form of placenta in the animal kingdom. The embryo directly hooks itself up to the host (mothers) blood flow, and leaves no tissue layers between the female and the placenta. This allows much more efficient nutrient transfer to the embryo or fetus, but is also potentially the most harmful to the female since the embryo attaches itself so securely to the uterine wall. The female must develop preemptive measures (a thickened uterine lining) to protect herself from a life-form that is literally driven to take all of the nutrients it needs to develop, and which has adapted to connect itself directly to the host. This group includes elephant shrews, most bats, and most primates. Interested in more about the science behind reproduction and how amazingly efficient the human embryo is at sucking its host clean, just to obtain its needed resources for development?  PZ Meyers at Pharyngula has an understandable explanation of the article I referenced for this post.  There is also a great site by R. Bowen about the pathophysiology of the reproductive system.

Dont do this.  Chromedome is tasked with delivering an important piece of evidence to a newly promoted Prowl, though its not quite the fuzzy reunion either of them want.  Readable under the cut or on AO3!  <!-- more -->  He followed the familiar pattern through the office. Veering around the desks and carefully squeezing past officers all speaking in fragments and marking notes on data boards. All of the windows were illuminated with the afternoon sun, lighting up the entire office. Chromedomes feet slowed as he neared the enclosed office on the far side of the room. Those windows were completely shielded by lowered blinds. Not a sliver of light escaped.  Chromedome paused for a moment, and rasped two knuckles against the office door.  A muffled voice reverberated through the door. One moment!  Lowering his hand, Chromedome glanced around the busy desks and meeting boards. The voice from the closed office was now barely discernable. The mnemosurgeon pretended that he wasnt trying to listen.  Yes Senator, I understand, Ill- There was a loud sigh. Yes, Ill have it taken care of. You have my word. I have to go. There was a clack, then a quickened sequence of thuds approaching the door, followed by the satisfying click of the lock, and finally the door swung open.  Chromedome turned around to greet the officer, like hed forgotten hed knocked in the first place.  Officer Prowls optics widened. Tumbler! He craned his head back slightly. I didnt think- I mean, its good to-  Tumblers voice was low. Yes, its good to see you too. Here. He raised a small airtight compartment. There was a tiny memory stick in it.  Prowl cocked an eyebrow at him, then slowly reached out for the box. This is the evidence I requested? But He slowly grasped the translucent cube, and stared at it in his hands. His expression sagged. I thought it was it was going to be delivered by a Chromedome.  Thats me, Chromedome said flatly.  Prowl looked up at him with half-lidded optics. I see. Ive heard a lot about you and your accomplishments. Prowl tapped his thumb against the cubes thick casing repeatedly for a moment. Congratulations, he said meekly.  Chromedome looked away, staring down an empty portion of the corridor at nothing in particular. Thank you. I read about your promotions, he said, turning back to Prowl.  Oh, yes. The timing was quite fortunate.  Chromedome folded his arms.  Prowl opened his mouth, then froze. He settled on a sigh.  Anything else? Chromedome asked.  No. The officer shifted his feet in place. I guess youd better go then. You must be busy.  Mhm. Chromedome nodded.  Prowls gaze drifted back to the sterile evidence cube in his hands. His turned it over, and gently thumbed at the ID-locked lid. He glanced back up to face his ex-partner. Well, thank you for-  Prowl paused again. He still felt the edges and grooves of the cube against his servos, standing alone in the doorway. There was a whipping thud as he kicked the door shut on the way back to his desk.   The office was dark again, now meagerly lit by the small desk lamp. Prowl stood over the neatly organized stacks of datapads, and lazily gazed at the blue terminal interface propped up on the desktop. The illuminated blue screen still showed the open case file. Prowls dimmed optics shifted from it to the evidence cube he was still slowly turning over in his hands.   He admired the stainless and reflective sheen of the little transparent container. He brushed his thumb along the bottom, wrapped his fingers around the bulk of it, and squeezed. The plates in his mouth ground against each other as the sharp edges of the cube cut into the gaps in his fingers. He wound his arm back and pitched the cube at the wall. It collided with a cracking bang as it bounced from the wall and clattered across the floor.  Shoulders raised and servos clawing at the air, Prowl gripped the edge of his desk and with a brief grunt, hurled it forward. Wires sparks and ripped from the pristine floor. The myriad of datapads and styluses spread across the room. The desk somersaulted in the air and crashed on its top against the floor, sliding a few inches towards the blinded windows. Prowls sole desk lamp had shattered underneath the desk and drowned the room in near total darkness.  Prowls flared optics instinctively shifted to a night vision green, and darted around the scene. He was hunched over, baring his dental plates and twitching his fingers. The heels of his feet ground and scraped at the white tiles. He stamped his feet against the floor and collapsed into his chair. Prowl sat, leaning forward with his elbows resting against his knees, and clasped a hand over his optics.",x,uniformshark:  Give away watercolor Aceo of Trepan for e512  Interested in getting one?

Andreas Deja was one of the many Disney animators to attend, and instead of getting Marc a store-bought card, he came up with an illustration of Maleficent (one of Marcs characters) being asked to dance by Jafar (one of the characters Andreas had animated).   In additon, he wrote the lyrics from an old song in order to point out that Maleficent had an influence on the way he designed and animated Jafar. Simple, clear lines and shapes, resulting in a stylized design for the character. Andreas animated some great villains from the Disney Renaissance, whereas Marc did two great villains from the golden age. He was truly inspired by Marcs work, what better way to show it than in making him this home-made card.  In the photo there is Andreas in the very 90s colorful shirt, giving Marc the card.

Its still something that I dont have all the answers for but I would like to make a bit of a difference; do something, anything, that causes people to have more sense of equality.  Imagine; I used to have really long blonde hair, always wearing heels, lots of make-up. I had been someone who was highly feminised and had chosen to look that way, partly because I was 6ft 3in but also I was into that aesthetic. I knew it had to be stripped away. I knew this would be an important part not just for my work but in terms of my own development, because I would be confronting elements of myself that I didnt want to confront. It was actors vanity and personal vanity. To see yourself displayed as unattractive, large, masculine, its quite tough But I know its just perspective. A social conditioning that causes us to view these traits in a woman in a negative way, but its still hard to watch myself even now.

Much of this was done through the old sci-fi trope of using aliens to stand in for oppressed groups, but Star Trek didnt rely on the metaphor; it had characters who were part of the ensemble, important and beloved members of the Enterprise crew, who were people of colour. It had background characters who were people of colour. And, here and there, it had anti-heroes and villains who were people of colour  one of whom, Khan Noonian Singh, became well-nigh iconic.  Image 1: Who is your favorite villain?; Actor John Cho (Lt Sulu) answers.  Image 2: TOS Khan looking at a watercolor of himself. Yes, hes wearing a dastar (Sikh turban)  Image 3: Cumberbatch and Montalbn (as Khan)  And who is now being played by white actor Benedict Cumberbatch in the new JJ Abrams reboot movie, Star Trek: Into Darkness.  Were all cynical and jaded enough to know the standard dismissal when it comes to matters of media representation: Paramount Pictures and most film studios are not interested in diversity or visibility, they only care about the bottom dollar. Star Trek as a franchise is too much of a juggernaut to affect with boycotts. There are too many people who love it, who love those characters and that world, and will go to see the movie. And for some of these people, this devotion to the idea of a future where even South and East Asian men get to pilot a starship and love swashbuckling, where Black women make Lieutenant on the Enterprise and actually get the boy, will be trivialized and eroded and whitewashed when the most formidable and complex Star Trek baddie becomes a white man named Khan.  It wasnt perfect in the 60s when Ricardo Montalbn was cast to play Khan (a character explicitly described in the episode script of Space Seed as being Sikh, from the Northern regions of India). But considering all of the barriers to representation that Roddenberry faced from the television networks, having a brown-skinned man play a brown character was a hard-won victory. Its disappointing and demoralizing that with the commercial power of Star Trek in his hands, JJ Abrams chose not to honour the original spirit of the show, or the symbolic heft of the Khan character, but to wield the whitewash brush for  what? The hopes that casting Benedict Cumberbatch would draw in a few more box office returns? Its doubly disappointing when you consider that Abrams was a creator of the television show Lost, which had so many well-rounded and beloved characters of colour in it.  Add to this the secrecy prior to release around Cumberbatchs role in the film, and what seems like a casting move that would typically be defended by cries of best actor for the job, not racism becomes something more cunning, more malicious. Yes, the obfuscation creates intrigue around and interest in the role, but it also prevents advocacy groups like Racebending.com from building campaigns to protest the whitewashing. This happened with the character of the Mandarin in Iron Man 3, as well as Miranda Tate in The Dark Knight Rises, who ended up being Talia al Ghul but played by French actress Marion Cotillard. This practice is well in effect in Hollywood; and after the negative press that was generated by angry anti-oppression activists and fans when Paramount had The Last Airbender in the works, studios are wising up. They dont want their racist practices to be called out, pointed at, and exposed before their movies are released  Airbender proved that these protests create enough bad feeling to affect their bottom line.  So the studio has now found a way to keep it secret and underhanded. Racebending.com was there for most of the production of The Last Airbender, and were even able to correspond with Paramount Pictures about it. This time, for Star Trek: Into Darkness, their hiding and opaque practices has managed to silence media watchdogs until the movies premiere.  As I said, this racist whitewashing of the character of Khan wont affect how much money this Trek movie makes. And Im happy that the franchise is popular, still popular enough to warrant not only a big-budget reboot with fantastic actors but also a sequel with that cast. Im happy that actors I enjoy like Zo Saldaa and John Cho are playing characters who mean so much to me, and that they, in respect for the groundbreaking contributions by Nichelle Nichols and George Takei in these roles, have paid homage to that past.  But all of that will be marred by having my own skin edited out, rendered worthless and silent and invisible when a South Asian man is portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch up on that screen. In the original Trek, Khan, with his brown skin, was an bermensch, intellectually and physically perfect, possessed of such charisma and drive that despite his efforts to gain control of the Enterprise, Captain Kirk (and many of the other officers) felt admiration for him.  And thats why the role has been taken away from actors of colour and given to a white man. Racebending.com has always pointed out that villains are generally played by people with darker skin, and thats true  unless the villain is one with intelligence, depth, complexity. One who garners sympathy from the audience, or if not sympathy, then  as from Kirk  grudging admiration. What this new Trek movie tells us, what JJ Abrams is telling us, is that no brown-skinned man can accomplish all that. That only by having Khan played by a white actor can the audience engage with and feel for him, believe that hes smart and capable and a match for our Enterprise crew.  What an enormous and horribly ironic step backwards. For Star Trek, for media representation, and for the vision of a future where we have transcended systemic, racist erasure.

THE ENDING the fucking ending. it was just wrapped up too perfectly yknow. tony defeats his demons! surgery! pepper fixed! happy lives! we cool! everything cool! we starting over now! i dunno, this is a lot of personal bias and slight emotional attachment but i was kind of disbelief when tony had the surgery and got rid of the arc reactor. like thats his thing! THATS HIS HEART. i dunno like it was all very refreshing and kind of uplifting but also very disappointing at the same time for me  more importantly i feel like the way everything wraps up into a neat little package undermines the struggles the characters went through in the series, especially tony. he just suddenly fixes himself after all the shit he went through in im2? that just bothered me a lot because the arc reactor and how it was keeping him alive was such a hurdle and they just sprinted on through it like, oh yeah we fix it now. i dunno the end was so perfect like when the kid gets off the bus i was half expecting his father to just show up and be like im sorry i left hugs like just so much rushed happiness  its not that i dont like happy endings its just that a lot of it wasnt built up to and didnt feel deserved in a way, and instead detracts from all the struggle tony went through in previous movies  also on that point, i felt like the movie had a somewhat confused tone at times. i and the friend i saw the movie with were expecting it to be much darker, seeing as it opens showing tony having a panic attack and being very effected by it. i felt that his anxiety had little pay off and was actually played more for laughs when he teams up with the little boy later on. again, in the end he just kind of gets over it or learns to deal with it- and its not that he had no reasons to do so but that idea got kind of lost and muddled in amidst the action and comedy of the movie. i dunno thats how i felt. i was expecting them to do more with the ptsd he seemed to be having; i was talking to my friend about how it seemed kind of tacked on in the end- tony seemed to have his shit together at the end of the avengers so when the anxiety is introduced and underdeveloped it just seemed like a loose thread  i dunno theres a lot of ambiguity in the end that leaves a lot of the story open to be explored later, but at the same time this felt like a final movie in a trilogy (idk if theyre making a 4th or what). like i like how they put the tony stark will return in the end, as if to assure us there would be more on his story. like i know that was like a bond reference but im just like tch he better like its bad enough no more arc reator and antman will be around  so yeah. i had some major issue with the ending and resolution of the movie but dont get me wrong i still really liked it otherwise, its just easier to rant about whats wrong than gush about what was awesome  8/10 would watch again  also i wrote this at like 10 am and its not the best analysis so if you find fault in my points im not rly down to debate but this is just what it thought and the opinion i formed a week after viewing it  ^^tumblr disclaimer heh  ok bye!! flies away",best page so far imo  we screamin now,side project #942012,sweet slow progress  ps i prolly wont upload any complete pages until after this is printed and yeah,start placing bets now on whether or not ill have my comic done and printed by the 24th,"by the way, i finished up with school as of yesterday, jfc im done  i have to pack and move back home and and get my wrist checked then start getting ready for comicpalooza so i cant promise a big increase in activity but maybe ill do a livestream tonight or tomorrow or monday or two fo those or all? yah  i can breathe again omg, thanks for sticking around during my school hiatus i appreciate it a lot heheheehehe"

In setting up a room to make this kind of photograph, I cover all windows with black plastic in order to achieve total darkness. Then, I cut a small hole in the material I use to cover the windows. This opening allows an inverted image of the view outside to flood onto the back walls of the room. Typically then I focused my large-format camera on the incoming image on the wall then make a camera exposure on film. In the beginning, exposures took from five to ten hours.

Its like giving away a bit of a magic trick, said Anderson, speaking by phone from Paris, between his promotional duties for the film in Venice and Toronto. I would hate to expose something, but Id be lying if I said he wasnt incredibly methodical and thoughtful about what he was doing but probably only in service of being able to then be completely unpredictable.   While the two never discussed at length what Freddie should look like, it quickly became clear to Anderson that Phoenix was losing a significant amount of weight to play this alcoholic fresh from the war. Phoenix also maintained an awkward gait, where he pulled his pelvis back, sucked in his stomach and placed his hands on his waist  a walk Anderson loved but never questioned.   Its like when you are playing make-believe with your kids and you are so tempted to ask them what they are thinking or why they are doing something but the last thing you want to do is break the spell, said Anderson, who realized in the editing room that Phoenix was perhaps holding onto his kidneys because they hurt from either a war injury or from all the booze. You just sort of hope they will keep doing it and they wont stop. Whatever he was doing, it felt so right and looked so good, the last thing I wanted to do was stop and break the spell of make-believe and ask questions of why.","Because of their iconic stature they are now among the most treasured and valuable of film memorabilia.

Murrows Person to Person show- exactly why she had taken this step: Its not that I object to doing musicals and comedies- in fact, I rather enjoy them- but Id like to do dramatic parts too.   In doing it alone, Marilyn was single-handedly taking on the all-powerful studio system. The immediate reaction at Twentieth Century-Fox was outrage. She was sued by the studio, mocked by colleagues, and vilified by the press. Meanwhile, Marilyn began what would turn out to be a sabbatical year. She stayed with the Greenes, lived in the Waldorf Astoria when in New York City, began studying with Lee Strasberg, and went into psychoanalysis. Greene dedicated himself to personally bankrolling the companys asset (Marilyn), generating movie projects, and working with the team of lawyers led by Delaney, who were renegotiating Marilyns contract with Fox.   It took a full year of negotiations before the fledgling company was in a position to announce that it had struck a revised non-exclusive deal with the studio. The huge success of The Seven Year Itch (1955) the previous summer considerably strengthened Marilyn Monroe Productions hand, and Marilyn beat the Fox into submission. Her new deal brought a check for past earnings, a new salary of $100,000 for four movies over a seven year period, and approval over all major aspects of her productions. Her victory created one of the first breaches in the Hollywood studio system.",There Will Be Blood vs The Master (x),"If somebody challenges me to do something, I say okay. I say okay very quickly.

deforest:  Mary Pickford by Harris & Ewing,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY HOWARD ASHMAN  Born May 17, 1950  I first met Howard when he came to my apartment to meet about collaborating on Rosewater. My first impression was that he seemed edgy and guarded. He wore torn jeans and a bomber jacket. He talked with a tight, intense energy, chain-smoking the entire time. And he was clearly very smart.  When Howard worked it was a total commitment. And every fiber in his being was brought to bear.  I wanted to throttle him on a regular basis. When we were working he could be controlling, impatient, demanding, cutting, arrogant and condescending. And yet, he was actually the most considerate, thoughtful, smart, compassionate, wise, generous and supportive friend Ive ever had.  -Alan Menken  Howard was a brilliant, complicated artist. I was not as close to him as some, but I saw him happy and I saw him mad. I saw him frustrated, and I saw him howl with laughter. I saw him caustic, and I saw him be disarmingly vulnerable. And Howard was a wonderful actor.  We learned a great deal from him. Ron [Clements] and I felt that songs should advance the story, but Howards ways of doing that were revelatory. He liked his songs to have information and to carry essential plot material. To take the key story beats and through the use of music to underline them and drive them home. From Howard, I learned the importance of grounding your writing in the specific, rather than the general. I watched Howards zealous defence of his material and ideas, anchored by their relationship to the story being told. All ideas are not created equal. There are definite reasons why some support the story more strongly, and we learned from Howard that those ideas must be defended. We saw inventiveness and passion from Howard in equal measure, qualities that produced art that has stood the test of time. We learned lessons of showmanship, of staging and characters, of using subtext to put ideas over more powerfully. We saw how Howard could tap into his own vulnerabilities and humanity and empathetically invest those in characters and songs that revealed those emotions. And dammit, Howard was funny. And he had a gift for effortlessly weaving comedy and vulnerability in a seamless way that made his creations (and ours and others) live.  He has touched me, and far countless others. He was a leader, a mentor, a collaborator, a musical genius, and a friend.  -John Musker  The reason he could [perform] so believably wasnt only that he was a great mimic  he was also empathetic. He really did feel your pain and it didnt matter if your pain was that of a Mermaid who longs for legs, or, back when we were young, the pain of a kid sister who thinks she is friendless and alone. I think that was maybe his best trait, the one I appreciated and miss the most.  Howard didnt often wear his heart on his sleeve, he could be tough and prickly as the best and worst of them, his humor could sting while it sent you rolling in the aisles. No, he didnt wear his heart on his sleeve, but those of us who knew and loved him and felt the warmth of that heart never had to look far to find it.  -Sarah Ashman Gillespie","lostsplendor:  Aerial View of New York City, 1931","Howard Ashman songs: The Mob Song from Beauty and the Beast (lyrics by Howard Ashman, music by Alan Menken)  If the title song is the texts emotional height, then The Mob Song is Beauty and the Beasts intellectual and suspenseful climax. It is lyrically the most impeccably crafted song in the entire piece, and is perhaps the most dramatic and theatrical piece of all of Howards works. Not only does it have something to say about character (Gaston as the evil force; the village as a frighteningly knowable character) and theme (the interplay between humanity and evil; responsibility and redemption), but it has something to say about the world of the viewer. The songs real power is in the truly unsettling way in which it points at you, saying, you - you are like this. You. We are like you. Furthermore, the most horrifying element of the text is Gastons transformation from human into beast. Not because it is unexpected, but because in that moment he represents human nature, and in this song the mob is just fulfilling human nature by following along with him. And its one exciting ride indeed - the very nature of manipulation and of participation in mob justice are explored with an accurate clarity that only becomes clear with a wider awareness of deep societal and historical meaning. It goes without saying that the mob song symbolizes and mocks mob mentality, but it takes you by surprise that it sends chills down your spine at how very real it is.   Analysed purely lyrically, The Mob Song is sublime; it even references a quote from Shakespeares Macbeth (Screw your courage to the sticking place), illustrating the pieces poetic merit. The perfect lyrical rhythm of the words powers through with a sense of urgency and dread, but they seem to burst with a sublime, gripping musicality that makes it impossible to refrain from tapping along with your feet, while still seated uncomfortably on the edge of your seat awaiting the inevitable. The disturbing and the entertaining; the silly and the dark; the clever and the damning are interwoven, culminating in this (yep, you guessed it) masterpiece of songwriting. The atmosphere and imagery that the rich lyrical and musical tapestry creates dominates the song from start to finish.  Greed hypnotised Gaston, Gaston hypnotised a village, and The Mob Song hypnotises the audience. This war chant gleefully mocks us as it reveals us unto ourselves; truthfully, mythically, completely. But not without a few trademark Ashman quips.   Were not safe until hes dead    Hell come stalking us at night    Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite  Hell wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free  So its time to take some action, boys; its time to follow me    Through the mist, through the woods  Through the darkness and the shadows  Its a nightmare but its one exciting ride  Say a prayer, then were there  At the drawbridge of a castle  And theres something truly terrible inside  Its a beast! Hes got fangs, razor sharp ones!  Massive paws, killer claws for the feast  Hear him roar! See him foam!  But were not coming home til hes dead  Good and dead!  Kill the Beast!  If youre not with us, youre against us! Well rid the village of this Beast. Whos with me?  I am! I am! I am!  Light your torch! Mount your horse!  Screw your courage to the sticking place!  Were counting on Gaston to lead the way!  Through a mist, through a wood  Where within a haunted castle  Somethings lurking that you dont see evry day!  Its a beast! One as tall as a mountain  We wont rest til hes good and deceased  Sally forth! Tally ho! Grab your sword! Grab your bow!  Praise the Lord and here we go!  Well lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!  We dont like what we dont understand in fact it scares us  And this monster is mysterious at least  Bring your guns! Bring your knives! Save your children and your wives  Well save our village and our lives  Well kill the Beast!    Take whatever booty you can find. But remember, the Beast is MINE!   Hearts ablaze, banners high, we go marching into battle  Unafraid although the danger just increased Raise the flag! Sing the song! Here we come, were fifty strong  And fifty Frenchmen cant be wrong  Lets kill the Beast!  Kill the Beast!  Kill the Beast  Kill the Beast!","weirdvintage:  Bum the nursemaid kitty, 1938 (via Modern Mechanix)","hollywoodlady:  Shirley Maclaine and her two 1/2 year old daughter Sachi Parker as they make faces during a photo shoot, January 1959.

Interestingly as I was gathering paintings for this reference , I came across this excerpt regarding the elaborate hairstyles that were fashionable during the 1770s from Marie-Antoinette Mother, Queen Maria Theresa to Marie-Antoinette.  In 1775, Queen Maria Theresa of Austria-Hungary wrote to her daughter Marie-Antoinette -Likewise I cannot help but touch upon a point that many of the papers repeat to me too often: it is the hairstyle that you wear. They say that from the roots it measures 36 pouces high and with all the feathers and ribbons that hold all of that up! You know that I have always been of the opinion that one should follow fashion moderately, but never carry it to excess. A pretty young queen full of charms has no need of all these follies. Quite the contrary. A simple hairstyle suits her better and is more appropriate for a queen. She must set the tone, and everyone will hurry to follow even your smallest errors  Marie-Antoinette responded - It is true that I am a bit occupied by my hairstyle, and as for the feathers, everyone wears them, and it would look extraordinarily out of place not to  (source: Hosford, Desmond.

"Im heartbroken that college has ended. I feel like someone died, honestly. I didnt think Id be this upset, but I am.  I miss my friends already.

After high school I was scared and I didnt think Id be able to make it to this day, but I did. Its moments like this where I realize that Im much stronger than I think I am.

While perusing Busters personal date books, we found this odd group of numbers that have us totally bumfuzzled! Heres hoping you can help figure out what they are!  Heres what we know:  - They arent mathematical computations. Buster was VERY precise in his financial calculations and these arent sums or totals. The decimal places dont make sense for arithmetic.  - This is the only time in the 10-year span of Busters date books that anything like this sequence of unexplainable numbers appears.  - They arent lists of serial numbers, catalog numbers, etc. He would have listed what each number was - not just the numbers by themselves.  - They are dated at the top of each page - so they have something to do with what was happening in his life in the months of September & October 1914, when he was 18 years old.  - The Three Keatons had just ended their summer sabbatical in Muskegon at this time, and had returned to performing in the mid-west. Nothing out of the ordinary.  - The entries on lines 10, 11, 13 & possibly 15 might end in lower-case letter b - not the numeral 6.  - Several sequences repeat themselves. 12288 repeats twice, as does 2717. Many of the numbers seem to end in 17 or 18.  - Weve looked at baseball stats, box scores, boxing match scores, horse racing forms, stock quotations, train schedules, etc. - nothing matches up.  So. all you crypto-peeps and math-gurus put your collective code-breaking hats on and see if you can solve Busters mystery numbers!

"The playground thrummed with the sounds of shouting and laughter. It was a warm, sunny day, and when the lunch bell rang we rocketed out of the double doors towards freedom and fresh air. I looked around at the swings, the basketball court, savoring my new surroundings. It had only been a month since Id been enrolled in ORION, our school districts enrichment program, and already I adored it. It was a place where everyone was like me! No one would make fun of me for having skipped a grade; no one would shun me for being lumped with the nerdy kids. We were all in the same boat; we all understood. I noticed a group of girls on the jungle gym and confidently, I joined in their climbing.    Excuse me, what are you doing? a voice demanded. I looked up directly into the irritated gaze of my classmate, Jean.    Playing, I replied pleasantly.    Jean sat on a wooden platform and folded her arms across her chest. We dont want you here.     I looked around. We shared the recess period with other classes in the schoolyes, that had to be it. There were unfamiliar kids near us; she must have mistaken me for one of them. When I laughed and kept on climbing, it was obvious Jean wasnt amused. She leaned down from her wooden perch and put her face inches from mine.     We dont want you here, she repeated. Nobody likes you.  I gulped. There was no mistaking her this time, and I was stunned by the shock. The cacophony around us had hushed, and I realized some of the kids were quietly watching us, snickering. The same kids with whom I felt safe, with whom I could relate. Why wasnt anyone telling her to stop? Why was no one coming to my aid? I sensed the pressure of dozens of eyes eagerly awaiting my answer, and my face flushed.  Butbut I just wanted to be like you, I stammered. Someone stifled a giggle. Jean smirked, her face grew hard, and then she spoke the words that changed my life.  Stop trying  you will never be one of us.  As she and the others went back to playing, I slid down from the jungle gym and waited dumbly by the fence for recess to end. Mercifully, the bell rang only minutes later, and my mind raced as I walked back to the classroom. Back in my regular school I was picked on and teased. I was left out of games and chosen last in gym. Fitting in just wasnt something that came easily to me, and Id blamed it on being younger, being different. But here, where everyone was different, I was still singled out. Jean said I would never be like them  could she be right? Was I truly an outcast, if you will, amongst outcasts?  Slowly, in the days that followed, something shifted in my thinking. There was no guaranteed spot for any of us. I might find solace with like-minded individuals, but the only person I would ever completely fit in with was myself. Each one of us is truly special and unique; why should I use all my energy striving to imitate someone who, in the end, wasnt like me at all?   From that day forward, no matter what befell me, no matter what continued to shape my world, I was awakened. I eventually made friends and found places and people with which I belonged, but through it all I only defined myself as one thing: me. This continues to serve me well as I walk my path through life. Not bad for an outcast amongst outcasts. I wonder what Jean would say.   Jennifer Ann Redmond  http://www.sketchbookproject.com/projects/memoirproject","whataboutbobbed:  COLLEEN MOORE - lost AND FOUND!!!!! WOWWWWWWW!!!  Ron Hutchinson of The Vitaphone Project here.  Our lost film news continues (after the discover of HELLO POP last month) with an announcement I am finally able to make! Colleen Moores final silent, WHY BE GOOD? (FN/29) was long believed to be lost. About 10 years ago while introducing one of my Vitaphone shows at NYCs Film Forum, I mentioned I had just acquired the Vitaphone disks (music and effects) for this feature but, sadly, the film was lost. Film historian Joe Yranski was sitting in the front row and yelled out No its not! I know where it is!. The crowd cheered, and so began a decades-long effort to get the film back to American and restored. Im happy to report that in a joint effort by Ned Price and Warner Brothers, the Bologna Archive in Italy, Joe Yranski (who knew Colleen Moore) and The Vitaphone Project, this film is now being restored. This is an ultra art deco film, with a super jazzy music and sound effects track with such greats as Jimmy Dorsey, Phil Napoleon, and Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang. It even has Jean Harlow as a dress extra! Truly the ultimate silent experience with something for everyone. Ned made all the arrangements to get the lone surviving 35mm nitrate print from Italy and disk transfers have already been completed.   This has been a long and difficult process, and knowing what went into getting to this point, I sure hope we dont hear any clueless its about time comments! WB is thrilled to fund BOTH of these restorations.  The print of Moores next to last silent with Vitaphone track, SYNTHETIC SIN (also thought lost) is also being repatriated now and restored.  So on the heels pf finding HELLO POP, some more MGM Colortones Ill soon announce, and the restoration-in-progress of over 50 1926-30 Vitaphone shorts, 2013 is sure shaping up as a banner year for film discoveries and restorations!","e.e. cummings, Book un-dedication to the 14 publishers who rejected him, artfully arranged as a concrete poem in the form of a funeral urn. +  Love this!","Hollywood before the Code   Pre-Codes.

But the Jazz Age could not live forever and Chicagos role in the development of jazz could not always keep stranglehold of its power on the music. Jazz, especially, is a music that always moves, always evolves. And when the music moves on, it takes on a new form, it transforms into something new and something more timely for the new era.  And while it is a simple fact that change is inevitable and that pop culture will always shapeshift to better fit the times, this common fact of nature is not the lone force that brought the demise of Chicago-style jazz. Rather, alongside this natural change there were specific factors, societal and musical, that contributed to the fall of the Chicago-style and the rise of swing.  <!-- more -->What Is Chicago-Style Jazz?  But before we can delve into the death of the Chicago-style, we must first understand it. Who were its players? What was its distinguishing sound? And, first and foremost, how did it come about?  Legend has said that a huge reason for the significant shift from jazzs home in New Orleans to Chicago was due to the closing of New Orleans celebrated red light district Storyville in 1917. Many New Orleans musicians also performed in bands on steamboats traveling up and down the Mississippi River and so it has long been said that jazz traveled up the river from New Orleans to Chicago.  In William Howland Kenneys Chicago Jazz: A Cultural History, 1904-1930, he argues that, in reality, the closure of Storyville was not necessarily the final straw that pushed jazz musicians upwards to Chicago - it only pushed the music (and the scandalous activities that took place in Storyville) to other surrounding neighborhoods in New Orleans. And while theres no doubt that jazz was traveling up and down the country in the riverboats, the Mississippi River doesnt flow through or very near Chicago.  Instead, the most logical explanation for the shift from New Orleans to Chicago lies in the first wave of the Great Migration (generally regarded to have occured from 1910-1930), in which many African-Americans moved from the rural American South to Northeastern and Midwestern cities. Jazz musicians were particularly interested in Chicago because of its thriving market for entertainment and popular music development.  Jazz greats such as Joe King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Jimmie Noone, and Jelly Roll Morton began to reach much critical, popular and creative acclaim following their move to Chicagos South Side in the late 1910s. While they brought the music of New Orleans with them, they also began adapting the music to fit the city and in doing so, they inspired musicians of all races from all over town including young, aspiring white musicians from the suburbs known as the Austin High Gang and a fellow from Iowa named Bix Beiderbecke.  (Clockwise, starting from top left: Joe King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Jimmie Noone, Louis Armstrong)  Chicago-style jazz of the 1920s and early 1930s is characterized by a very hot, energetic, almost frantic sound. While Chicago-style still utilizes collective improvisation, the focus on individual soloists becomes incredibly important. In this style, elaborate introductions and endings become increasingly common, saxophones began to take on a role in jazz, and time signatures generally switch from the common New Orleans 4/4 to a shuffling 2/4. Where New Orleans-style was characterized by a sense of ease and leisure, Chicago-style is all about tension and drive. Chicago-style bands tended to be of a small or moderate size, usually consisting of no more than 9 or 10 players.  The End of The Chicago-Style Era  One of the biggest factors in the death of the Chicago-style was the end of the Jazz Age, particularly the end of Prohibition and the onset of the Great Depression.  A crackdown on the organized crime that was centered in 1920s Chicago brought the first blow. The brutal St. Valentines Day Massacre in 1929 drove the public to push for more police control. Police raids on speakeasies, especially South Side clubs, increased and this actually increased gang violence for a while, making clubs even more unsafe for jazz musicians.  In what History and Tradition of Jazz author Thomas Larson calls the final blow to the jazz age in Chicago, the twenty-first amendment - the repeal of Prohibition - was passed in 1933. With the repeal of prohibition on alcohol and increased political reforming, many key Chicago speakeasies and nightclubs closed. The Jazz Age, with its loose morals and bootleg gin on which this style of jazz thrived, was officially over.  And though New York had already begun to tantalize and pull in jazz musicians in the late 1920s, the city now seemed even more inviting. With the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression on the rise, jazz musicians were drawn to the jobs available in New Yorks many nightclubs and theatres. Radio and recording industries, as well as the sheet music publishers of Tin Pan Alley, were now centered in New York.  But what may have also had a detrimental effect on the demise of the Chicago-style was the tragic deaths of many of its key players. The deaths of cornetist Bix Beiderbecke and reedman Frank Teschemacher, two of the most influential musicians of the style, were especially hard-hitting blows.  (Frank Teschemacher, left, and Bix Beiderbecke, right)  Bix Beiderbecke was a huge influential and innovative figure in the midwestern jazz scene of the 1920s, alongside Louis Armstrong (and both men were mutual admirers). Part of Beiderbeckes unique musical voice was his clear, bell-like tone on the cornet and a cooler, more lyrical approach to jazz, decades before the cool jazz movement. He had an impeccable musical ear and he was a huge influence to black and white musicians alike.  Frank Teschemacher, commonly known as Tesch, was one of the original members (and, according to many, the musical leader) of the infamous Austin High Gang, the group of young men from the Chicago suburbs who were instrumental in forming the Chicago-style. Teschemachers style of playing the clarinet and alto sax was incredibly unique and distinctive - angular, fiery, and passionate, with a piercing tone and cornet-like phrasing. The wild, driving characteristic of Teschs playing became characteristic of the Chicago-style as a whole.  Though Beiderbeckes death in 1931 was not entirely unexpected (Paul Whiteman had granted him a paid leave to rest due to noticeable health ailments), it had an incredible impact on the jazz scene that was felt far and wide. The death of such an influential figure, along with the societal factors previously mentioned, left many musicians mournful and discouraged.  Teschemacher, an ardent admirer of Bix Beiderbecke, unfortunately met an untimely end like his hero. His death, however, was far more sudden and unexpected: he died from severe head injuries following a car accident in which trumpeter Wild Bill Davison was driving the automobile. The two were putting together their own big band, a project which ultimately fell apart after the abrupt tragedy.  Beiderbeckes death is the most remembered and may have had a wider impact on a larger scale but Teschemachers death was basically the final straw. In the Teschemacher entry of American National Biography, he is described as perhaps the most versatile of the Beiderbecke disciples and, after Beiderbeckes death, he was their most ardent cheerleader. With his death, Chicago-style jazz had lost its last ringleader, and many believe the spirit of the Chicago-style died with him. The fact that Beiderbecke, a giant in the scene, and Teschemacher, the dedicated disciple, died within months of each other was daunting. Some of the younger budding jazzmen at the time even started wondering if Chicago jazz was cursed.*   Jazz mythos aside, it is extremely odd that so many key players were taken so soon and within such a short time-frame. Clarinetist Don Murray, who played with and was close friends with Bix Beiderbecke, died a few years prior to Bix in 1929, from severe head injuries after a car accident at age 25 eerily similar to Teschs death three years later. Eddie Lang, a guitarist most notable for his brilliant work alongside Bix and Frank Trumbauer, died a year after Teschemacher from complications following a tonsillectomy.  Interestingly enough, an In Memoriam page for these 4 young jazzmen (and Carleton Coon of the Coon-Sanders Orchestra) appears in a concert program for New Yorks First Swing Music Concert, held at the Imperial Theatre on May 24, 1936. It seems so symbolic of the transition from Chicago-style to swing, honoring the ill-fated Chicago-style and its innovative players while celebrating the onset of the swing era simultaneously.  (In Memoriam page as found in the Imperial Theatre 1936 concert program)  The Dawn of the Swing Era  So the music began to lose some of the gritty edge that helped characterize the Chicago-style and, though still loud and exuberant, it became smoother, more dance-oriented, and more commercially-appealing. Jazz took on the new form of swing, and in this new form jazz became the mainstream popular music. Big bands are truly big, usually with 17 or more players, neatly divided into sections by instrument. Collective improvisation is even less important as individual solos become the norm.  Many credit Benny Goodmans incredibly well-received concert at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in 1936 to have been the official start of what we now call the swing era. Goodman himself came of age in the Chicago-style era and was well-associated with the Austin High Gang. As a clarinetist, he was influenced by fellow young clarinetist Frank Teschemacher even though their playing styles were very different from each other.  Benny Goodman became one of the most popular bandleaders of the age of swing but he was far from the only one. Other bandleaders such as Duke Ellington, Artie Shaw, Count Basie, and Glenn Miller were elevated to a celebrity status and became household names.   The swing era injected a country stricken with a harsh economic depression with the vigor and optimism to keep going. With its harmonic sophistication and danceable rhythms, swing music brought jazz to an even more widespread audience and provided a high-energy yet sentimental soundtrack for the war years ahead.    * I cannot for the life of me find where I had read this anecdote, though I clearly remember reading it.

Several of his compositions have become jazz standards. He was awarded with a number of honors, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an Honorary PhD from Berklee College of Music, the Legion of Honor by the country of France, and a posthumous Pulitzer Prize.  Duke Ellington died on May 24, 1974 at age 75 from lung cancer and pneumonia.","<!-- more -->After having a wonderful discussion with one of my dearest friends regarding my jazz+hip-hop/rap post, she mentioned that, though jazz and rock and roll were indeed scandalous, they utilized subtle references and double entendres to do so and were a lot less explicit and excessive than what we tend to see in rap and hip-hop today. This outright explicit and excessive profanity is most likely what keeps a lot of the older generation as well as the current generation at a distance.  And I think thats a pretty interesting and valid point to make. But some could argue that the profanity is part of the artists personal expression. Yet, when does it reach the point of being excessive or does it even reach that point? Is that really for anyone to dictate? (These are questions I dont have the answer to and are surely up for debate.)  And it might be useful to consider that to use explicit profanity in the days of jazz and early rock and roll would have resulted in being unable to record the song, radio refusing to air the song, and probably being prohibited from playing the song on stage. Therefore, that may be a huge reason for the use of double entendres and subtleties - a way to work around the censors. Now, if there were no censors, would the jazz musicians and early rock n rollers still used these suggestive methods or would they have used explicit profanity?

How does that make sense in the slightest?  OKeh owes most, if not all, of its popularity and success in the 1920s and 1930s to African-Americans. And though its great that theyve signed international musicians (as part of their global perspective approach), the omission of African-American jazz musicians is glaring. Its as though theyre ignoring such a vital part of the musics history and future. Which really contradicts their attempts at showcasing the global jazz community.  Considering theyve only just recently been announcing their lineup of signed artists, hopefully well be hearing announcements of African-American jazz musicians being signed to the label soon.","Jazz Appreciation Month  Jazz birthdays in the month of April  Dave Tough, born April 26, 1907  Dave Tough was a drummer and an early associate of the infamous young Austin High Gang.

It was a lament Ive heard frequently: How did we go from jazz to hip-hop?  Oh I dont know, the inevitable evolution of music in which new styles take inspiration and influence from the ones that came before it, perhaps? Just a hunch.  And of course its followed by exasperated pleas of Where is the CLASS nowadays? That music is all about drugs and sex and theres no talent to be found whatsoever. The music scene has finally reached rock bottom, and this music is corrupting our youth, and our youth are corrupting all of society, etc etc. Kids these days.  But you know what? The same was said about jazz all those years ago.  Youre either forgetting or ignoring the historical context of these styles of music. Youre ignoring a cultural pattern that has been present in music history for centuries upon centuries. Whether it was jazz in the 1920s, rock n roll in the 1950s and 60s, or hip-hop and rap in the 1970s to the present day*, every new music genre that forms is met with criticism by the older generations that say its too loud and raucous, its too scandalous, its not real music.  These are the soundtracks of youth throughout generations and they have never been initially welcomed with open arms.  So lets talk about jazz for a second. The word itself is thought to be derived from the slang word jasm (meaning spunk, energy, vigor) which was also thought to be derived from jism, a slang word for semen. In the early days of the musics gestation and birth in New Orleans, jazz was associated with the famed red-light district Storyville where early jazz musicians often played in brothels and bars. Jazzs syncopated rhythms and intense energy often made it perfect for scandalous dancing, and many early jazz tunes had lyrics full of blatant double entendres and references to sex and drugs; some were outright explicit (see Jelly Roll Mortons Make Me A Pallet on the Floor recorded here in 1938 for ethnomusicologist/folklorist Alan Lomax).  Once jazz reached its adolescence and began influencing more of popular music and pop culture in the 1920s, it rapidly gained a reputation for being immoral and for promoting the decadence of the Roaring Twenties. As jazz started reaching a white middle-class teen audience, parents were appalled and believed this music would ruin their children. Many white youngsters started aspiring to become jazz musicians, the greatest example of this being the Austin High Gang that originated in the Chicago suburbs and greatly influenced the Chicago-style of the 1920s and early 1930s. And their parents, for the most part, did not approve.  In a strictly musical sense, Professor Henry Van Dyck of Princeton University said of jazz: As I understand it, it is not music at all. It is merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing, a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion. Its fault lies not in syncopation, for that is a legitimate device when sparingly used. But jazz is an unmitigated cacophony, a combination of disagreeable sounds in complicated discords, a willful ugliness and a deliberate vulgarity.**  Sounds a lot like the complaints over hip-hop and rap, doesnt it? And now look, weve elevated jazz almost to the status of an an art music. Its oft considered Americas art music.  I should also mention that had you asked me my thoughts on hip-hop, rap, and the current mainstream music scene 6 years ago, I would have spouted out the whole its not REAL music, the music scene today is worthless, blah blah blah spiel. But that was when I was 13, and had not delved nearly as deep into music and the study of music as much as I (pretentiously) thought I did. My view was biased and narrow and I have only recently (say, in the last 2 years or so) begun to broaden my musical horizons. I am in no way an expert on music evolution and music history and all the different genres and subgenres of music - I will constantly be learning. And while I still dont know much about hip-hop and rap, Im much more willing to learn and listen to it. Im warming up to it. And hey, I may end up finding that its just not my thing or it might not ever become my favorite type of music but I cannot say that its completely vapid and disregard the cultural contexts from which it grew out of. (Also, if anyone who reads this has any hip-hop/rap recommendations that you think I should check out, by all means share them with me!)  Sure not all hip-hop and rap music is great. Neither is all rock music, or jazz music, or even classical music. Its unfair to generalize an entire style. Music is relative and is open to so much interpretation amongst each listener.  And if you really look at it, jazz essentially paved the way for hip-hop and rap. Im not saying you have to like it but the least you could do is acknowledge it as an actual music style. Because it is. Whether you like it or not.    * I could argue that techno or electronic music be added to this list as it also pertains to this current generations music scene and tends to be looked down upon as well.  ** Source: Ward, Geoffrey C.; Ken Burns (2000).

Although the Code was adopted in 1930, oversight was poor and it did not become rigorously enforced until July 1, 1934. Before that date, movie content was restricted more by local laws, negotiations between the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) and the major studios, and popular opinion than strict adherence to the Hays Code, which was often ignored by Hollywood filmmakers.    As a result, films in the late 1920s and early 1930s included sexual innuendo, miscegenation, profanity, illegal drug use, promiscuity, prostitution, infidelity, abortion, intense violence and homosexuality.","Greer Garson, 1943","barbarastanwyck:  Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor in Volendam, Holland with two local little girls in traditional attire, 1947","harlow-jean:  There was something special about the girl, recalled Nancy Carroll .

Here is a list of available recordings that he made, as well as some he might have been on, all of which were made in the prime of his musical career.  1927~  with McKenzie and Condons Chicagoans (Tesch on clarinet): Sugar | China Boy | Nobodys Sweetheart | Liza  1928~  with Charles Pierce and His Orchestra (Tesch on clarinet and alto sax): Bull Frog Blues | China Boy | Jazz Me Blues | Sister Kate | Nobodys Sweetheart  with the Chicago Rhythm Kings (Tesch on clarinet): Baby, Wont You Please Come Home | Therell Be Some Changes Made | Ive Found a New Baby  with the Jungle Kings (Tesch on clarinet): Friar Point Shuffle | Darktown Struttters Ball  with Miff Moles Little Molers (Tesch on clarinet): One Step to Heaven (Windy City Stomp) | Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble  with Eddie Condons Quartet (Tesch on clarinet and alto sax): Oh Baby (Rain or Shine) | Indiana  with The Big Aces (Tesch on clarinet and tenor sax): Cherry (Take A) | Cherry (Take B) | Cherry (Take C)  currently unavailable  with The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra (Tesch on clarinet and tenor sax; note: hes hard to hear on these recordings due to the other horns): Round Evening | Out of the Dawn  with Wingy Manone and His Club Royale Orchestra (Tesch on clarinet): Trying to Stop My Crying | Isnt There A Little Love?  1929~  with Ted Lewis and His Band (Tesch on clarinet; note: Ted Lewis is playing clarinet as well, but you can tell the difference between the two ;P): Farewell Blues | Wabash Blues  with Elmer Schoebel and His Friars Society Orchestra (Tesch on clarinet): Copenhagen | Prince of Wails  1930~  with The Cellar Boys (Tesch on clarinet): Wailing Blues (Take A) | Wailing Blues (Take B) | Barrel House Stomp (Take A) | Barrel House Stomp (Take B) | Barrel House Stomp (Take C)  Recordings that Frank Teschemacher might be present on:  with Sam Lanins Famous Players (1928): Too Busy  with the Ipana Troubadours (1928): Nagasaki  with the Original Wolverines (1928): Limehouse Blues | Dear Old Southland  Frank Teschemacher greatly admired Bix Beiderbecke and his work. I highly recommend others to listen to Frank Teschemachers music."

Ive fallen for her extraordinary personality, killer looks, and a heart that has no limits.   Ive been cautious all my life. Ive been cautious about letting people in and out. Fortunately, she has been let in even deeper than anyone else has ever been. Im more than glad that this girl was the one that I have let sink into me rather than it be anyone else in the world. Shes been the most caring, supportive, humorous, attractive, loving, person and I will never trade her for anything.   I havent been so happy with someone.   Shes made me happier than anyone else has ever had.  And I want to spend the rest of my life with her.   Youve fallen asleep and youll probably see this when you wake up.   Good morning!

Ferguson which allowed segregation under the doctrine separate but equal. The case had been bought by African-American parents, including Oliver L. Brown, against Topekas educational segregation. It was argued before the Court by the chief legal counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP): Thurgood Marshall, who became the first African-American Supreme Court justice in 1967. The Court, led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, declared that segregation violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The landmark decision is considered the start of the Civil Rights Movement which led to racial integration and full legal rights for African-Americans.  We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal - Warrens opinion for the Court","thepensivebrony:  you shouldnt be depressed, people have it worse than you  finally, after years of searching, the person with the worst life ever is found. formally, they are granted permission to be sad. but only them. only they have earned it. no sads for anyone else at all ever",xime2:  #respect #different #abilities #visible #disability,"drunkonstephen:  So, no.

So it would be the three of us. Going to see a movie.  My response was Um. No.  He said, I used to go w/ him and xxhis bffs crazy ex girlfriendxx to see movies and that wasnt weird.  I respond, I didnt say it was weird - but, if we are going to see a movie sans kids, Id want to treat it as a date - ie, no other people. And its different when you went to see a movie with them because THEY DIDNT HAVE CHILDREN. They already spent every night together alone, whereas you and I only have these times w/o the boys.  He understood and did feel bad, but because hes a man, he already said it was cool w/ his bff before checking w/ me..so I said they could go since they havent seen each other in a while.

HGRomance has since won our hearts many times over with Admirer, Goddess, and, most recently, Rebel. In contexts as unexpected as an Amish farm, she paints distinctive worlds in which new aspects of Katniss and Peetas characters and courtship are in the foreground. Yet, these are always, at heart, the K/P we love and the romance (and Happily Ever After ending) they deserve. In this interview, HGRomance talks about developing compelling AUs, what is so enduring about Everlark, andof courseBad Boy!Peeta.   rainydaysanyways & jeniezee     (Warning: Admirer, Legend, and Rebel spoilers below. Banners by Ro Nordmann)  Hi! We are such great fans of your stories. Thank you so much for agreeing to this interview!   My pleasure! Thank you for having me!   Lets start with some general questions about you as writer. What brought you to fanfiction and to the THG fandom?    Oh, I remember this clearly! It was almost exactly a year ago, right after I finished reading Mockingjay. I was on vacation in this little mountain house, curled up on a rocking chair and staring into the fireplace. I was thinking about how Katniss had done that same hypnotic thing for months before Peeta returned to 12. The more I thought of them, the more I missed the characters.    Id been aware of fanfiction, so I grabbed my iPad and discovered Five Words Peeta Only Says at Night by aimmyarrowshigh. My jaw dropped, and I was like, Im in Mellark Heaven!   Your stories are amazingly creative and each so distinctive! What inspires you, and how do you decide which story ideas to pursue?    Im devoted to YA authors and their novels. Theyre the biggest inspiration for me. As for what stories to pursue, I go with my gut and what Im most excited about. When I latch onto the right storyline, everything flows.   What is your writing process like?    Its pretty straightforward. Once I get an idea, I brainstorm anything that pops into my head: scenes, backstory, conflicts, etc. Most important to me are the motivations of Katniss and Peeta. I need to know what they want, why they want it, and what keeps them from getting it. I need to know what brings them together and what keeps them apart. Then I make a general outline, just enough to know the major turning points. Keeping it broad allows me to still be surprised as Im writing. And then I write about four pages a day.   Why do you choose to fully complete a story then publish it one chapter at a time? We certainly appreciate it as readers because your stories are so captivating, and waiting long periods for updates would be torture.    Well, my goal is always to complete a story before posting, but so far Ive gotten to about 75% complete when the first chapter goes up. But even if I did manage to finish 100% of a story, I would still post one chapter at a time because I love getting reader responses to each update. Many times, they bring up great points or questions that allow me to adjust future chapters. And its just fun to build anticipation!   You have worked with DustWriter (beta) on Goddess, Legend, and Rebel. Can you tell us a little about how the collaboration came about? Do you have any advice for new fic writers on how to develop strong and productive writer-beta relationships?    DustWriter and I clicked pretty fast! I sent her a fan PM and mentioned that I wanted to do a Robin Hood story. She liked the idea and offered to take a look at it. After I sent her the first four chapters of Legend, she said I had to publish it and that she wasnt giving me a choice. She needed to know what happened next. It was the best encouragement.    For betas, I would say to be sure that you like one anothers writing. You should enjoy what youre reading in order to give it the attention it deserves. Then be communicative about what you need, whether its help with grammar or content or both. Ask questions and find the balance that works for both of you.   The stories youve written so far are all set outside Panem. What do you enjoy about writing AUs, and what do you see as the biggest challenges?    AUs have no boundaries. I get giddy over the what if of placing Everlark in a new time and place, and seeing how the universal aspects of THG carry over. The biggest challenge is making Katniss and Peeta recognizable to the readers in spite of the setting change. Keeping their basic traits intact is important to me.   Are there any aspects of canon that you dislike or wish were different?    Sigh. I ached to see more of Katniss and Peeta growing back together in Mockingjay. And the final paragraph of them making lovedang it. It was beautiful but abstract. I would have pulled out my hair for a detail or two, a piece of discarded clothing (preferably Peetas), a movement, a sound.    How do you approach those frustrating parts of canon in your stories?    I focus mainly on their romance throughout the entire story, so you see them growing together from their first meeting. And I write sex scenes!   And for that, we are very appreciative.   Your username is HGRomance. What do you find romantic?    There is nothing more romantic than the first kiss. The build-up, the anticipation, the moment. Its my favorite part of reading a story.    What continues to draw you back to Katniss and Peetas relationship?    My God, they are the most dynamic couple Ive ever read about. So raw, complex, and tender. Despite a war and a hijacking, they still found their way back to each other, and in a more real way than before. Their love is the ultimate symbol of hope. I try my best to honor that in my stories.   Your  profile includes a list of things that youd like to see in Everlark fics. Why do you think these things havent been written yet?    Hmm. For the Everlark premises, I could see how some of them would be challenging to turn into a romantic plot. But it would be cool if Katniss had to testify at the Mockingjay Trial and was tricked into admitting shes in love with Peeta while on the stand. Or what if she hadnt run into her tent after giving the double-knot your shoelaces speech to him? What if the rest of the Star Squad had been asleep? It doesnt have to be a huge shift from canon, but it could lead to a simple heated look or touch.    If you could challenge other writers to take on one particular prompt, what would it be?    I would love to see a ghost story. Imagine the rebellion is only known in the history books, and Katniss moves into the Victors Village, which is rumored to be haunted. And she meets and falls in love with Peeta, the victor whose spirit dwells in his former house. I want to read that!   Well, there you have it, folks. A challenged offered by HGRomance!   Youve mentioned in your profile that you like a Happily Ever After ending for Everlark. Have you ever considered writing a non-HEA ending?    For Katniss and Peeta? Nooooo.    Do you read non-HEA stories?    Its more like I stumble upon them. Cant predict all endings, but if the author has a warning or I get a sense of a tragic ending, I scamper away.   Alright. Lets delve into some of the specifics of your stories.      Admirer is such a wonderful adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac/THG! You wrote it as a Prompts in Panem (PiP) story. How did you come up with that idea, and what compelled you to write it?    I was excited about a mistaken identity and comedy of errors plot. That and the idea of secret love letters. When I thought about merging these things together, it reminded me of Cyrano. I couldnt resist. I still laugh at the balcony scene between Delly, Katniss, and Peeta.   Other than Admirer, all your other stories are multi-chapter fics. What was different about writing a one-shot?    Its a very different experience. The shorter the word count, the less time you have to build things up. The pacing changes, the focus is tightened, and yet it still needs to be a fully-developed story, with substance and a character arc. You have to dive in, you have to dive deeper, and you have to do it fast.    Katnisss letters in Admirer are so beautifully written. Can you tell us a little about how you approached writing the letters and about giving Katniss (as Cyrano) a distinctive written voice?    Poetically, I know what Peetas capable of. So while he was the obvious candidate to write love letters, that didnt interest me. And although he drew the sketches for the Mockingjay memory book, Katniss was the one who wrote the actual memories. Shes also the narrator of the trilogy. She may be quiet, but internally she does have a way with words. So I knew she could pull off an admirer role.    As Cyrano, I wanted her prose to be passionate and truthful but not sappy. The words of a girl who believes shell always be anonymous to the boy she loves, but whos also aware of her craft. She wants to prove to herself shes capable of beauty even though she doesnt believe herself to be beautiful. But the third letter shows her vulnerable side because it isnt composed. Her emotions spill onto the page in free emotional form.      You so seamlessly (and unexpectedly) blended mythological and modern elements in Goddess. Why did you choose a modern setting for the story?    It felt like a refreshing contrast to mythology, literally and figuratively. History versus the future, which represents one of the choices Katniss has to make. And I wanted her to be lonely in spite of her role as a love deity. Which meant she had to be in the mortal world, isolated from the Gods. A small winter-set town added to that sense of isolation.    Goddess is such a whimsical story. Thats an interesting juxtaposition with the dispirited backstories of Peeta and Katniss. What drew you to such a fanciful story?    Magical and paranormal themes are my favorite, and Goddess has such a fairytale tone. Despite the dark veneer, fairytales have a certain lightness in their prose. Katniss and Peeta are delightfully child-like and visceral, and I figured, as a goddess, Katniss would be naughty. So all those things shaped the language and the storys form.    The parallels between the deities and THG characters were so cleverly drawn. If you were to assign a god to Peeta, which one would he be?    Hahaha. If he were a hunter deity, hed be Hope. But as a God? This is a toss-up. I would say hed be the male Psyche, as deity of the soul and Cupids counterpart. But I just discovered a god called Matton, supposedly a demi-god of the meal and, get this, kneading of dough! So Im torn.      Peeta is much more action-oriented and also more of a leader in Legend than in most Everlark fics. Had you made a decision to try to switch Katniss and Peetas roles from the books?    Well, I have a tendency to role reverse with Everlark. Robin Hood is an archer like Katniss, but when I thought about her taking on Marians role, the plot and all its twists fell into place, so I knew Peeta as Robin was the right choice. Plus, I really wanted to see him do all those bow tricks. The vision was too sexy to ignore.   What do you see as Peetas strengths, in the books and in Legend?    He has the qualities of a natural leader, hes giving and confident, and hes clever. Like Robin.   Readers have talked a lot about the lake scene in Legend. Can you tell us about writing that scene and how you developed it?    I really, really, really wanted to read a fanfic scene where something sensual actually happened in the lake! I kept reading all these great stories where Katniss went for a swim but nothing more. The lake scene satisfied my craving. The immediacy of their chemistry, the high stakes, and the overwhelming circumstances allowed me to push the pacing boundariesto the point where Katniss and Peetas abrupt passion startles them.    Katniss and Rue fall in with Peeta and his merry band of rogues. We really enjoyed the way you used the minor characters in this story. Which were your favorites to write?    For minor characters, definitely Jo and Gale. Their relationship amused me, and I always get a kick out of pushing Gales buttons in stories. Theres something about his hot-headednesshes like a furious bear clumsily swatting at flies.      Finally, what everyones been waiting for. Lets talk about Rebel!Peeta. He made quite an impression.    *Oh, blush*   Other than in dark!Peeta fics, we very rarely see Peeta portrayed as a bad boy in fic. Can you tell us about his characterization in Rebel?    I have to credit the breathtaking Josh Hutcherson for that. I thought to myself, he has tattoos, he wears aviators, he rides a motorcyclebut he plays Peeta. I imagined Peeta with those characteristics and fell in love.    Were you at all concerned about how readers might react to that first chapter?    Hell yes! That was the biggest concern for me. My first question to DustWriter was, Is he likeable?    In spite of his flaws, it was my job to make his redeemable traits accessible to the readers. If readers didnt see those traits, they wouldnt have cared about Peeta. I had to balance his bad boy exterior with sympathetic emotions and actions: he lost his father, he lives in an abusive household, he loves his brothers and is protective of them, he takes the fall for Rye. There needed to be glimpses of the Peeta we love, enough for people to believe there was more to him beneath the surface.   Why do you think people were so drawn to this character?    I think its the whole smokin package. His walk. His talk. I loved everything that came out of his mouth! In a guy with an underlying good side, a bit of danger and rebellion are tempting. Hes a classic archetypethe volatile, troubled soul whos untamable until he meets the right girl to open his heart.   What inspired his character? His dialogue? Everything about that character was pure seduction.    *Smiling* I couldnt decide what kind of bad boy I wanted to write. Did I want him to be aggressive, with an uncensored vocabulary like Will Hunting? Did I want him to be a rogue, who can purr his way into a girls bed, like Valmont from Dangerous Liaisons? Both intrigued me, so I combined them. From there, he took charge of all the scenes he was in. His presence was so commanding.   Katniss is a wonderful surprise in Rebel. Beneath a calm, steady surface she has a lively mind and daring spirit. What was important to you in your characterization of Katniss in this and other stories?    She needed to be multi-layered in order for Peeta to have an affect on her. At the onset, her life is restricted yet she has secret wishes, most of which she doesnt recognize until later in the story. Shes solid, but only because shes never been challenged. And quite simply, shes a young girl whose drifting between adolescence and adulthood, and the freedom her rebel visitor embodies taps into her desire for individuality. To me, thats very Katniss.   The origins of Katnisss strength is different in Rebel than in canon. Its no longer tied to protecting the ones she loves or her survival. What characteristic do you think inherently make her a strong character, and why Peeta is attracted to her?    I think hes attracted to her selflessness and loyalty to her family. In terms of his father and brothers, he can relate. I think he admires her honesty, because what she says, she means. And I think hes drawn to the fiery spirit he discovers on his first night on the farm.   Finnicks character was an unexpected yet delightful surprise. Why did you choose to characterize him that way?    Ah, Finnick! The first picture I had of him was blowing smoke rings while leaning against his Mustang, then him grabbing Peetas chin and trying to kiss him. Its a hint I dropped in Chapter One about his feelings towards his best friend. In the trilogy, Finnicks flirtatious, flamboyant, and his ultimate sexual preference is ambiguous despite Annie. But hes filled with longing, so making him bi-sexual and in secretly love with Peeta happened organically.    Can you tell us a little about the research that went into writing Rebel?    Actually, part of my research came from what Id read about the Abnegation faction in Veronica Roths Divergent. Their lifestyle struck me as similar to the Amish. Aside from that, I peeked online for more details and answers to questions that came up as I wrote. One of the interesting tidbits was that the Amish dont allow themselves to be photographed. Since Peeta is an artist, I thought that would be a great contrast to explore.  As for the type of Amish community Id be writing about, I learned there are so many different Orders, with different rules. I realized the best way to establish authority, limit factual errors, and serve the plot was to create an imaginary Order, in an imaginary town.    Did you have any aha! moments as you were doing research, where something you found really fit with or perhaps changed the way the story was developing?    Rumspringa! That was unexpected. I came across the NPR story based on Tom Shachtmans book, Rumspringa: To Be or Not To Be Amish. The excerpt describing what kids do during that time was eye-popping. I hadnt planned on Peeta taking Katniss into the city, but once I found that piece of info, I revved up the motorcycle! Rumspringa bridged the gap between worlds and provided the endings resolution.   Can you give us a glimpse of how you see Rebel!Katniss and Peeta in five years or so?    I see Peeta spray-painting the words Marry Me onto the wall across from their bed, so its the first thing Katniss sees when she wakes up in the morning.   I think weve established that we love every form of Peeta that you write. There have been so many incarnations of Peeta in fics, why do you think hes such a malleable character?    No question, Peetas the embodiment of both tenderness and toughness. Hes sweet and tolerant, but he does a lot of brave, assertive things in THG. He fluidly straddles the line between a soft and solid character. Plus, weve seen him at his brightest and darkest, so theres a lot to work with.   In all your stories there is a sexual awakening for Katniss. Was that a conscious decision? Is that an aspect of their relationship you like to explore?    Very intentional indeed. Its interesting to explore Katniss from this angle because, in the books, shes rather detached from her sexuality. Yet in certain moments, like the beach scene in the Quarter Quell, shes unconsciously passionate. I like to bring that out in my stories.    Do you ever worry about how your stories are received?    Totally! Thats natural for writers, right? We all want readers to be happy and to return to our stories. The hiccup is when the critiques arent constructive or are basically harsh. Were human, we care about our stories, and none of us are fully immune. Its impossible to please everyone, and we shouldnt try towe can only do our best, hope to connect to our audience through our characters, and learn how to make use of the reviews that do help and encourage our writing.   Storytelling is a courageous act. It takes generosity and a great deal of bravery to put our writing out there. Its scary, but its also incredibly rewarding and fun. Its worth it!   Have you ever received any reviews that made you question your choices?   Gosh, Im glad I have my coffee for this question. Not with regard to the overall story or anything major, but readers have expressed confusion over certain details, or the expectation that things will be explained more. Im grateful for those instances. No one knows our stories better than we do, but readers do catch things we might not see because were so immersed in the story that we cant look at it objectively anymore: logistical issues, inexplicable character actions, etc. Oftentimes, we need fresh eyes and outside perspectives for that.   This is where constructive reviews and beta readers are amazing. In my experience, theyve made my stories so much stronger. As long as were writers, there will always be something new to learn, new ways to look at the storys format or content, to make it richer and more engaging.   Where would you draw the line between wanting to satisfy readers while maintaining your artistic integrity?   When readers have suggestions or wishes for the story, I listen. If theres general confusion, or if a bunch of readers point out the same thing (perhaps an inconsistency or emotional disconnect from the character), I listen. Like I said, authors can get so deep into the text that we become blind to certain issues or possibilities.   However, my ultimate decisions come from my gut. In the end, the choices have to feel right.   What advice would you give to novice writers?    Know your characters. Always make sure they have a good reason for doing what they do. Give your audience someone to care about and connect with.    How do you think one becomes a better writer?    By writing every single day.   Well, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us about your stories. We look forward to many more amazing works from you.  Oh, and just a fun little note. Keep an eye out for Legend, because an epilogue is finally taking shape in my mind.  And thank you! Ive never done an interview before.

Lets start with the most general question. Why do you write fanfiction?  Because I like it! I have a billion ideas in my head, and I like being able to put them onto paper. I like stories, and I like writing. I like exploring different characters, different plotlines, different worlds, and fanfiction is the perfect way to do that.   What was the first story you ever wrote?  The first story I ever wrote was a Harry Potter fanfiction featuring James and Lily that I started about six and a half years ago. It took me three years to complete, was almost 200,000 words, and was pretty much like every other HP fanfiction that features James and Lily in school.   What do you think when you look back on it now?  It was terribly written! I was an awful writer, and I wouldnt want anyone who reads my fanfiction these days to read that story from years ago. I cant bear to think about stories that I wrote a few months ago, let alone a few years ago! And the plot was a little crazy, but I think I deserve brownie points for sheer absurdity.   Has your style and approach to writing fics changed since then?  I mean, I think Im a better writer, and I think Im better at putting together coherent plots, but Ive always been a little bit all over the place as far as my approach to writing fic. Overall, my writing process probably hasnt changed very much.   How would you describe your writing process?  I tend to write a lot and scrap a lot. I write and write and write, stop, look everything over, delete about three-fourths, edit whats left, and continue writing, writing, writing.     Do you ever worry about the reception of your stories?   Always! Usually, because I dont publish everything I write, what I choose to publish is what I think is my best, thus Im always worried that people wont like it. When Im new to fandom, I feel a little less pressure, because no one expects anything good from me. I mean, thats not to say that I dont want people to like my stories and to be excited about more, but at this point in the Hunger Games fandom I get insanely nervous about disappointing people.     With all these edits in addition to the anxiety, how do you know when a fic is done and ready to publish?  Honestly, if I get to the point where I tie off the plot and the story has an END, I consider the story finished. I could go over the various scenes over and over, but I tend to do that WHILE writing. I very rarely change lots once Ive completed the plot. Im sure that shows in how many typos are always littering my stories!   How does a story develop for you? Do you typically come up with one scene and create a story around it?   Something like that. I guess Id say I tend to build more around a specific idea, or a bone to pick that I have, than an actual scene. I wrote All This Waiting For Skies To Fall because I wanted to write a story where Haymitch was a father figure to Katniss from childhood onward; obviously, that developed a lot. Often, the original idea I have changes a lot as Im writing. To be honest, when I plan a fic out entirely from the very start, writing everything down, I tend to lose interest and never really write it.     Thats interesting. But even without a full outline, you always know how the story ends?  I always have an initial idea how I want the story to end, yes. I cant start a story without thinking about how everything might end. I tend to change my mind a lot, though, as a write. Sometimes little stuff changes, e.g., originally Gale was supposed to end up with Johanna Mason in Knot Your Fingers Through Mine, and sometimes big stuff changes, e.g., the very first plan for All This Waiting For Skies to Fall had Gale ending up in the Games with Katniss rather than Peeta.    You use lyrics in all your stories. How do you pick them? Or do specific ones inspire you to write a story?  Usually, I pick a song from the three or four that I listened to the most while I was writing the story. Im not a musical person, but I cant write in silence, and sometimes the music that Im listening to starts to feel right with the story, which is why the lyrics are pasted into the top. Also, that means I dont have to come up with titles on my own!    Whats the hardest part of crafting a story?   The freakin title! Or, to be serious, I think I struggle the most with trying to put idea I have onto paper. Is that a lame answer? I imagine stories while Im running, I think about them when Im bored in the car, I fall asleep having imaginary conversations between characters in my head. I sound like a very sane person, I know. But I have a billion ideas, and the hardest part about writing is translating those ideas into actual stories.     So, how do you organize all these ideas and decide which ones are worth pursuing?   Basically, the ideas that I end up pursuing are the ones that manage to stick; theyre the ones that I keep returning to, keep imagining different ways the plot could go, keep getting excited about trying to write. I mean, like I said above, I always have some kind of ending in mind when I start writing, so if Im unable to come up with a possible ending for an idea, Im not going to pursue it.    Speaking of having a plethora of ideas, you write for multiple fandoms. Is there a common appeal that these fandoms share that makes you want to write for them?   Ive never thought about that. I guess, usually, I write fics from fandoms that have whole worlds for me to explore, e.g., The Hunger Games, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Once Upon a Time. But at the same time I guess what really draws me to fanfiction is how I attached I am to the characters in a fandom, and I dont want the story to end. Or, of course, there are times when characters that I like act in ways I dont like, and I feel the next to fix things.   What drew you to The Hunger Games and to write about Peeta and Katniss?  I didnt want the story to end! I started looking up post-Mockingjay fanfiction online about an hour after I finished the book.   Do you have a favorite scene from THG series?  I dont think I do. I really liked the moments when Katniss would think something that implied she was in love with Peeta but didnt realize it. I loved that. I loved the way that she slowly fell in love with him; thats the only experience with love that I know, and every little moment where Katniss revealed her unintentional love for Peeta made me smile.   Do you prefer to write in Peetas or Katnisss POV?  Nope, I dont have a preference! Theyre difficult to write in different ways, easy in others. I dont have to try to write anything poetic when Katniss is in charge, but Peeta tends to be an easier egg to crack as far as characterization. I like Katniss as a character more than I do Peeta, but that doesnt necessarily translate into getting their characterizations right.     What would you say are the main characteristics of Katniss and Peeta you always try to maintain in your stories?   Oh, you know, when you ask me that my mind goes blank! Im not good at articulating this stuff! I guess I view Katniss as very straightforwardand somewhat oblivious for it, because she doesnt understand when other people arent being straightforward. I think she is very unforgiving, and I mean that in a good and in a bad way. She isnt necessarily beautiful or brilliant, but she is very much an everyman, determined to do what she needs to do to protect the people that she loves. She doesnt know how to laugh at herself, isnt any good at articulating her feelings, and doesnt have much appreciation for the smaller things in life.  As for Peeta, I would say his sweetness is key as well as his ability to laugh at himself and to find happiness. Ive met very few people in my life who get along easily with others, find reasons to smile about everything, and can tease you into a good mood, and that is how I envision him to be. He is patient, and he is very forgivingand I mean that in a good and a bad way! He is very self aware in a way that Katniss isnt.     Have you ever had an idea for an Everlark fic where these characteristics just dont fit into the story?  I cant say that Ive run into that problem very often, to be honest. I guess I tweak those characteristics some in AUs in which I think the point is that circumstances have altered their characters somewhat. Thats the case with All This Waiting For Skies to Fall; Katniss is different because she was raised in a different situation. I guess that means when I have an idea for a fic where those characters wouldnt fit, I have a reason WHY Katniss and/or Peeta have different characteristics. I think this is what most authors do, and its definitely walking a fine line.     With the exception of KYFTM, youve only written Everlark one-shots. Do you prefer one-shots to multi-chapter fics?  I definitely prefer one-shots, because I can quit them without disappointing anyone!   Youve mentioned before that youve abandoned one-shots after putting in substantial effort into them. Does that happen often? Do you ever feel the urge to go back and finish them or are they scrapped for good?  It happens fairly often. I checked, and there are six Hunger Games fics that Ive started and have never finished. I keep abandoned fics in a folder that Ive literally labeled graveyard, and occasionally, when Im feeling uninspired, Ill root through them, trying to convince myself that I want to pick up where I left off, but that never really happens. More often, I end up stealing scenes from them for another fic. I can think about ONE example where I abandoned a story only to end up finishing it months later.     So, I have to ask about Ghosts with Just Voices. Due to the ambiguous ending, I think many of us were hoping you would continue the story. Do you have plans to do so?  I started to write a sequel pretty soon after I finished the story, actually! I ended up writing a little over 10,000 words before I abandoned ship. I dont remember why at this point; I think I mightve gotten involved in another THG story, and the sequel fell at the wayside. Honestly, Im torn about it. I want to write more, because I know exactly what is supposed to happen next and where I would go with a sequel, but Im very iffy about sequels in general. And the structure for Ghosts with Just Voices doesnt really lend itself to a sequel. But see, now after talking about it for a minute I want to go look at the sequel and see whether Im interested in finishing it! Ack!   Why did you decide to write a multi-chapter for KYFTM?  Im trying to think about it, and I dont remember! I guess because I thought I had enough to do a multi-chapter. It drives me a little crazy when I think multi-chapter stories drag on for no reason, and I dont want to do that, which is why I can fit most ideas I have into one-shots, albeit rather long one-shots.    Do you think youll write more multi-chapter stories?  I honestly have no idea. If I get an idea for one that demands to be written, I wont be able to help myself! But theyre a big commitment, and I havent had much time for fanfiction in general lately.     Even though it was a multi-chapter, each chapter was as long as one of your one-shots. As a reader, I personally love that about this story. Can you comment on that?  Basically, I think that making people wait for updates means that I ought to at least make the updates substantial. I want stuff to HAPPEN every chapter, which means that they need to be longer.   With KYFTM, you were getting reader feedback on the chapters you had posted as you were still writing the rest. Did reviewers comments influence your story in any way?  On one front, they definitely did. I didnt think about the fact that people who arent from the Statesor some who are!might not know very much about the [Civil] war. A few people commented on doing a little research to try to understand, or they simply mentioned, I didnt really understand this, but I liked this! I decided, therefore, to try to include a background on the war in a conversation between Katniss and a soldier. I like to think that helped people!   KYFTM is your first historical AU story. What inspired you to go in that direction?   I pulled out my old notes for the story to answer this! Ive written historical fanfiction before for another fandom, and I really loved it, and for whatever reason I got it into my head that my love for the Civil War would help create a cool story about Katniss and Peeta living in a hotel that mirrors the arena. Or thats what my scribbles from months ago tell me. I really dont remember why I decided to write it, although I remember being nervous that the idea was stupid, because no one would care to read a fic about Katniss and Peeta in the Civil War.   How did you approach the research for this story? Was it difficult writing dialogue to accurately portray that era?  I spent a long time Googling period language, and I read several letters from Civil War soldiers. My mother is a Civil War special collections librarian, and I pestered her a lot to make sure that the plot twists I wanted to do would actually be historically feasible.    Do you typically prefer writing canon or AU?  AU, hands down. As far as Im concerned, there is only so much in canon left for me to explore, because the books covered a lot of ground, and I want to put the characters in new, different scenarios. Ive seen on tumblr that some people really dont like that, because they dont consider that fanfiction, but thats exactly what fanfiction is to me.    Are there any aspects from canon that you particularly dislike and would change to incorporate into your stories?  I have immense, immense hatred for love triangles. I dont dislike Gale at all; in fact, I think I, personally, would fall for someone like Gale before I would for someone like Peeta. But I dont like love triangles. Are romances really that boring when they arent challenged with a love triangle? I tend to turn Gale into simply a friend whenever possible in my fics. And, well, I always thought that the third book wasnt very good, and I really didnt like the ending. Really, this simply translates to my enjoying writing AU fic where things dont play out the same way.   You seem to have a running list of prompts for various fandoms to write. How do you manage to juggle so many WIPs at the same time?  Honestly, I have no idea! I dont have any trouble keeping multiple ideas in my head, but Ill often become more excited about one, which will be my focus until Ive written the next chapter and can switch gears.   You are an incredibly prolific author. Do you get writers block?  I do! Doesnt everybody?   How do you deal with it?  Usually, when I become frustrated with a story, I simply skip ahead to write another scene, something that Im excited to write. I start writing backwards every once in awhile, going from the final scene back to wherever writers block hit. The plot tends to change a lot as I deal with writers block, but that makes writing more fun! Of course, sometimes I simply quit the story.      Do you ever get stuck on certain descriptions? How do you come up with descriptions that dont sound forced or repetitive?  I do, but more often I have trouble putting plot pieces together rather than struggling to describe something in particular. And I think, to a degree, I am actually pretty repetitive in my descriptions; thats something I ought to work on. Im not as good at pretty language like some THG authors! I have the most trouble trying to describe action scenes, but that simply means that I avoid them like a plague and, when I cant, I have to labor over them for a while.   What sort of surroundings create your perfect writing space?  I like to parallel play with people. Its where I hang out with my friends but dont ACTUALLY interact with them; I do my own thing, and they do theirs. Its named after the way little kids play when they play at the same time, in the same room without actually playing with each other. Basically, I dont like to be alone, but I like to have alone time! At the moment, my roommates are lounging around on my bedroom floor talking to each other. I like that; I like that theyre here, but obviously Im doing something completely separate from them!      Youve mentioned on your blog that you are a university student. Do you think fic writingor just the practice of writing regularly and writing so muchhas helped your academic writing?  I think its actually more the reverse; I think the classes Ive taken in school have really helped improve my writing in fanfiction. As lame as this might sound, Ive learned a lot in school!     What is the biggest risk that youve taken as a writer?  I guess historical fanfiction. The changes that youll make a mistake are much greater, and you risk looking pretty stupid when you dont do enough research. You have to be willing to devote a lot more time to writing historical fic! Honestly, though, as silly as this sounds, putting your writing up online for others to seeand to judgeis a big risk to me! I dont really like people I know in real life reading my stories, because Im very anxious about people judging me for my writing; putting stuff up online is a big deal for me!      Do you have any other THG projects in the works? Are there any teasers you can give us?   Do you mean for KYFTM? Theres the epilogue, which I WILL finish, dammit!   Or do you mean for the Hunger Games in general? I like to tell myself that I will! I like writing THG fic, but there isnt any story that I want to tell at the moment. I have a few more ideas, but, well, the Hunger Games fandom is a wee bit sophisticated, and I think they would laugh at the ideas I have, which means theyre for my mind to enjoy and thats it!     Oh, I dont believe for a second anyone would laugh at these ideas youre depriving us of! But can you elaborate on what you mean by sophisticated?    I appreciate the vote of confidence! When I say, sophisticated, I mean that people in the THG fandom are pretty devoted to the books and are pretty passionate about literary critique. Theyre constantly analyzing everything, the characters, the plot, the messages, and many stories are reflections on that. I like discussing that stuff, but it means that there arent as many stories that are simply fun plots, if that makes sense.     What advice would you give to novice writers? Or writers who are insecure about their abilities? How do you think one becomes a better writer?  Go for it, and practice will help make perfect! The more you write, the better you are, because you learn what works. Also, read. A lot. Theres a famous quote about reading books to be a better writer. Hold on. Let me look it up. Okay, got it! Its William Faulkner. Now, I would choose Hemingway over Faulkner any day, but I love this quote: Read, read, read. Read everythingtrash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! Youll absorb it. Then write. If its good, youll find out. If its not, throw it out of the window.     Well, thank you for taking the time to chat with us. We are all looking forward to the epilogue of KYFTM (ahem) as well as your future works. Thank you for sharing your wonderful stories with us.   Thanks for taking the time to talk to me and to come up with questions for me! This whole idea you guys have to interview authors is really cool!",Welcoming the lovely and talented jeniezee aboard as co-moderator!  Thank you to everyone who read and shared our first interview. We are tremendously grateful to tigers24 for helping us kick things off.,"tigers24is the writer of For You to Notice Me and the forthcoming Slacks & Calluses.  <!-- more -->  Interviewers Notes:  The inspiration for these interviews came as I was reading John Greens The Fault in Our Stars. That book features two characters drawn together, in part, by a shared love of books and the desire for the story to continue, to live in the excitement of infinite fiction. I was struck by how these themes resonated with my experience as a fanfiction reader and the excitement of discovering a community of fans creating infinite fiction through their stories and art.   Its no coincidence, then, that this first interview is with the person who introduced me to TFIOS and commiserated with mevia tumblr, of courseas I turned the final page. Her tumblr URL is i-like-my-choices, but fanfiction readers likely know Jackie as tigers24. Her recently completed story, For You To Notice Me, is a modern AU that follows Peeta Mellark from middle school to college as he faces all the struggles of growing up and also growing to be the person that Katniss Everdeen could love. Jackie shares her thoughts on creating multidimensional characters, keeping it real, and her forthcoming historical AU, Slacks and Calluses.  (Warning: FYTNM spoilers below)  tigers24 is the author of For You to Notice Me and Slacks and Calluses.  You just finished For You to Notice Me. How did it feel to post that final chapter?  It was very rewarding. I had been working on it since May and to finally complete it definitely felt awesome, especially because I know how long people had been waiting between updates.  FYTNM has one of the most memorable openings of any Everlark fic Ive read. How did you come up with that as the opening scene?  It just kind of popped into my head one day and I began jotting down scenes in my word document. The next thing I knew, I had written chapter one. But I think mostly, there are no other fics where Peeta is with someone other than Katniss, and I wanted to change that. I just didnt find it realistic.  FYTNM is written from Peetas perspective. What worked for you in writing it that way? Were there ever times when you wished, as a writer, that you werent inside Peetas head?  Definitely not. I feel like not enough fan fictions are based in his perspective. I think what worked for me, in particular, is because I feel like I kind of get him. Being in love with a girl who doesnt know for a long period of time? Check. Having a crazy mother? Check. For me, there was no other way of writing it other than from his take.  Peeta isnt perfect by nature in this fic, he really struggles to figure out how to be a good person and make the right choices in his life. Why was that important to you?  Because I wanted it to be real. I wanted people to struggle along with him as he figured it out, because in reality, thats what we do and how we evolve into the people we want to be. It was also important for me that his other love interests were likable characters. I wanted him to feel conflicted, but in order to do that, the reader needed to feel conflicted as well. Because otherwise, him finding his way back to Katniss in the end would be less significant.  I think anyone who has read FYTNM has to be impressed the way you so adeptly cut between different periods of Peetas life. How did you keep the timeline and narrative straight as you were writing? How much of the story did you have planned out before you started writing?  I dont make outlines, mainly because I dont believe in forcing. I dont really plan a whole lot either. What I originally intended the ending to be is very much different from the final outcome, so even if I do have something in mind, a lot of times, I deviate from it. The timeline was difficult, definitely imperfect, and Im sure going back and reading from start to finish, there are more errors to be found. I already know of a few things I made mistakes on (like Dellys aunts name is mixed up in chapter four.) I will hopefully be correcting some of those as I post the non-beta-worked chapters in the next week.  Do you have a chapter or scene that you especially enjoyed writing?   Not enjoyed writing so much, but my favorite part in the whole story is the bathroom scene where Peeta loses it and makes Madge take off his shirt. It was one that kind of just hit me, and after I went back and read it, I was really happy with how raw it felt.  One of my favorite aspects of the story is the way that you use foodthe peanut butter cookies, Cheez-its, pesto. I know you manage a restaurant. How much did you draw on that part of your life in writing Honest Abes and other aspects of FYTNM?  FYTNM was a very personal fic for me, and I drew most of it from my own experiences. In many of the scenes, especially the ones with Peetas grandfather, they were pulled directly from my life. I think working in a restaurant was just one more way I could relate to him.  FYTNM Delly is a treasure, and there was a huge outcry for Melly. What shaped your characterization of her?  What I really wanted to have was supporting characters that were more than merely just there, and thats what she was for me. I also really wanted the fic to be multidimensional, and depicting her as fun and sassy helped accomplish that.  At seamsluts request, you wrote a little Madge epilogue for us. Can you give us a glimpse of what a Delly epilogue might involve?  I hinted at the fact that eventually there would be a time for her and Mitch. I may write a one shot in the future, I may not.  I cant ask you about FYTNM without bringing up that incredibly hot piano scene. Do you play piano or have you ever taken lessons?  I am a little self-taught, but ultimately, no.  Any advice on writing hot smut? Or not writing not-hot smut?  I say:  write smut how you are capable. Not all of us are going to be good at it (I myself included) and just stick with what you feel comfortable writing.  Stepping back, what drew you to THG fic? Had you read or written fic in other fandoms?   My partner got really into it and I quickly followed suit. And no, I havent written for other fandoms.  What were your expectations when you started writing fic?   To find a hobby and not suck at it  Your first story was the super-hot Win a Date with Katniss Everdeen. What did you learn from writing that first fic?  Basically, it was a learning experience for me. After not writing for seven years, it really helped me get back in the swing of things and learn my strengths and weaknesses. It didnt take me long to realize I bit off a bit more than I can chew with that particular fic. I still love the concept and everything about the storyline, I just think that at the time, and still now, its beyond my writing capabilities. I will be probably taking it down from the site, or at least 95 percent of the text, and working on it periodically until I get it right and feel comfortable re-posting.  What is your writing process like?   I sit down and begin jotting down thoughts and images in my head and attempt to turn them into scenes.  When and where do you do most of your writing? Do you have any rituals that help get you in the mindset for writing?  I do most of my writing at the kitchen table.Usually, cheez-its and wheat thins help set the mood.  Do you ever get writers block? How do you deal with it?  Yes. I dealt with this for a majority of the summer months, which highly affected me and took a toll on my confidence. What actually helped get me back on track was writing prompts that sparked my interest and a fellow writer giving me advice. She said: concentrate more on actions and less on emotions. Sometimes going back to the basics is what you need.  Do you ever get nervous posting your writing?  Every time. Ive learned to just trust what I post, and If Im not comfortable with it, dont. Many times I have rewritten sections after a chapter is complete until I get to that point.  Sometimes as a reader its hard to know how to leave a good review. What kind of feedback has been most helpful for you?  Long reviews talking about aspects readers liked and didnt like is extremely helpful.  When you post chapters of a WIP, youre getting feedback from readers as youre writing. Does that feedback affect your writing at all? Have you ever changed a story or added anything because of a review?  Not really. Obviously criticism is welcome - and a reader brought attention some grammatical errors I fixed, but as far as storyline is concerned - no.  Do you ever include easter eggs or inside jokes in your stories?  Hahahah. Yes. Peanut Butter and Jelly and fruity pebbles. A certain individual has picked up on both of these things.  It seems like theres a lot of fantastic fic in the THG fandom right now. Is there any aspect of the books or characters that you think may be underexplored or underappreciated?  I think Johanna, in general, is a great character and Id love to see a good fic focused on her.  What kinds of things are important to you in a good fic? What do you enjoy as a reader?  I think that strong character development and a good plot are the most important. I am a pretty stereotypical woman, so I enjoy romance usually the most.  Do you have any personal dealbreakers when it comes to reading fic?  Fics that drag on forever. Also, the reference of penis as glorious manhood.  Youve written some of my favorite PiP stories. Do you approach writing a one-shot differently from a multi-fic story?  For me, its much different. The focus is usually on one scene or an accelerated version of a fic.  If you could challenge your fellow writers with a prompt, what would it be?  Honestly, this fandom is so talented, theyve come up with just about everything and more.  Youre about to start a historical AU, Slacks and Calluses. Can you tell us about the setting for that story and what inspired you to choose it?  Its set in post-World War II in Detroit and will concentrate on Katniss and how she deals with sexism and racism as they come along. Its inspired by the feminist in me, really.  How has the research been going for S&C? Any fun discoveries that you can share?  Im actually going to the Henry Ford Museum to learn more about auto factory work environments. I really want to be able to capture that as I think its an imperative part of the storyline.  What are some of your favorite things to read? Are there any books or authors that have influenced your writing style?  My favorite things to read are stories that stay true to the characters. Id definitely say that some of the talented authors in this fandom have helped me grow as a writer and have influenced how I write. silvercistern, who creates a really strong voice perspective definitely influenced me, as well as bleedtolovehers impeccable ability to capture scenery and imagery. I also feel that Sarah Watersan amazing historical novelist who portrays strong female charactershas strongly impacted the way I write. She is everything I aspire to be as a writer and more.  Stepping back, when you were reading THG, did you have any favorite scenes or favorite lines from the books?  The scene that always stood out to me was the one where Peeta and Gale discuss Katniss and that she would choose whoever she cant live without.  Youve shared that while your wife reads fics from the Twilight fandom, Bella isnt your kind of female protagonist. What do you appreciate about Katniss or other favorite female characters?  Bella Swan is a weak character who portrays herself as needing a man to survive, and to me, this represents everything that is wrong with the world. Katniss is the exact opposite and a respectable female character.  What did you think of the movie?  I enjoyed it, but there are things that infuriate me about it as well. Mainly the characters they chose to leave out and the lack of class struggle. Never once do they talk about Peeta being from a merchant family and her from the Seam either, which I believe to be an important aspect of their relationship.  If you were advising Francis Lawrence on CF, what would you suggest?  That Peeta shouldnt have both his legs.  Your tumblr blog is wonderful. You share everything from drink recommendations (#booze porn) to pics of sexy ladies to funny/frustrating shit your employees do. How did you end up on tumblr, and what do you enjoy about it?  I ended up on tumblr after reading Maybe Its Just Me. The first person I followed was bleedtoloveher and soon after discovered silvercistern and falafel_waffel. Its kind of all ancient history after that.  Do people in your real life know about your alter ego as a fic writer and THG blogger extraordinaire?  My partner does. Nobody aside from her.  What role has fic had in your life?  I think its given me something to strive towards and care about.  What are the best things about the THG fandom?  I think one of the best things about the fandom is having people to relate to. Not many others will understand when you accidentally call a colleague named Pete, Peeta. Its like having an awesome extended family and I really enjoy it. Many of these people are humble, incredibly talented and lovely.  Have you ever met up with any of your fandom friends in real life?  Hahaha. Yes, I do know one person in day to day life, and she has quickly become a close friend.  Your URL is i-like-my-choices. If you had to choose one:  bears, beets, or Battlestar Gallactica?  Hahaha. Bears, I suppose.  Okay, perhaps a more difficult question:  Anne Hathaway, Garrett Hedlund, or Jim Halpert?  Anne Hathaway.  Three things about you that might surprise readers?  I dont think much will surprise them at this point. Most of them know Im crazy.  If I wasnt writing for the THG fandom, I would probably be  Drowning in policy proposal misery and working too much.     Jackies writing is posted on AO3 and FFNet. Her tumblr URL is i-like-my-choices.","Thank you for following Sheaf of Arrows.

Published 1908 by George bell & Sons, London.  See the complete book here.  The story takes place aboard the British ship H.M.S. Pinafore. The captains daughter, Josephine, is in love with a lower-class sailor, Ralph Rackstraw, although her father intends her to marry Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty. She abides by her fathers wishes at first, but Sir Josephs advocacy of the equality of humankind encourages Ralph and Josephine to overturn conventional social order. They declare their love for each other and eventually plan to elope. The captain discovers this plan, but, as in many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise disclosure changes things dramatically near the end of the story. (Source)"

"fucking-history:  Istanbul, Turkey c.1959 (source)","Palestinian smugglers are using a network of tunnels dug under the Gaza Strips border with Egypt to bring a new flavor to the Israel-blockaded enclave: fried chicken from U.S. fast-food chain KFC.  Since Israel tightened a blockade on the coastal territory six years ago, Palestinians have used the tunnels to smuggle everything from fuel to livestock - and even cars - from the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula.  Now, a Gaza-based delivery service company known as Yamama, or pigeon, has taken to delivering Kentucky Fried Chicken all over the Gaza Strip.  Yamamas motorcycle couriers ride to the Egyptian border, pick up the chicken from one of the tunnels, and deliver it to customers.  The meals are made at KFC stores in various cities throughout the Sinai Peninsula, because there are no KFC restaurants in Gaza. A KFC restaurant opened last year in the West Bank city of Ramallah.  Israel tightened a blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2007 after the militant group Hamas seized control of the territory from secular Fatah rivals, who govern the West Bank.  Anyone who wants to eat real Kentucky Fried Chicken can call our office in Gaza, give his name and his telephone number and say exactly how many meals he wants, said Ibrahim, a Yamama motorbike rider.  Yamamas owners said the new business began by accident when the companys motorbike riders offered to order KFC meals.  It usually takes three hours for the meal to be brought from Egypt to Gaza and less than an hour to bring it from the tunnel and give it to the customer, Ibrahim said.  The company has a website (http://www.ymama.ps) featuring pictures of Egyptian fast food. It also has a page on Facebook, where customers can place orders for KFC deliveries the next day.  But the lengthy delivery time, sometimes prolonged by Hamas inspections or holdups on the Egyptian side, takes its toll.  It is really very delicious although it is not very hot, said Eyad, a 21-year-old Gaza student.

It has become known as Cat Island due to the large stray cat population that thrives as a result of the local belief that feeding cats will bring wealth and good fortune. The cat population is now larger than the human population on the island.  There is a small cat shrine Neko-jinja (?) in the middle of the island, roughly situated between the two villages. In the past, the islanders raised silkworms for silk, and cats were kept in order to keep the mouse population down (because mice are a natural predator of silkworms). Fixed-net fishing was popular on the island after the Edo Period and fishermen from other areas would come and stay on the island overnight. The cats would go to the inns where the fishermen were staying and beg for scraps. Over time, the fishermen developed a fondness for the cats and would observe the cats closely, interpreting their actions as predictions of the weather and fish patterns. One day, when the fishermen were collecting rocks to use with the fixed-nets, a stray rock fell and killed one of the cats. The fishermen, feeling sorry for the loss of the cat, buried it and enshrined it at this location on the island.  There are at least ten cat shrines in Miyagi Prefecture. There are also 51 stone monuments in the shape of cats.

"cavetocanvas:  Jusepe de Ribera, Aristotle, 1637  From the Indianapolis Museum of Art:  Riberas image of Aristotle is one of a series of six imaginary portraits of ancient philosophers commissioned in 1636 by the prince of Liechtenstein. Riberas conception of Aristotle as an ordinary man wearing a scholars skullcap and a ragged robe, a beggar philosopher, is a type that enjoyed great popularity in the 17th century. The artists direct, naturalistic style and his dramatic use of light, both of which derive from the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, combine to create a powerful evocation of a philosopher deep in thought.  Jusepe de Ribera, born in the Valencian town of Jtiva in 1591, spent his entire career in Italy, principally in Naples, which was then governed by Spanish viceroys. He frequently asserted his Spanish nationality, as he does in this painting, by adding the word espaol to his signature. In 1618, the year Ribera received his first commission from the Spanish viceroy, the artist Ludovico Carracci wrote with admiration of the young Spaniard working in the manner of Caravaggio. The bold Caravaggesque naturalism of Riberas work is enhanced by his achievement of a more tactile sense of physical presence, readily seen in the thickly brushed lines and creases of his philosophers worn face and coarse hands.","cavetocanvas:  Jusepe de Ribera, St. Jerome and the Angel, 1637",welovepaintings:  Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) Portrait Of Mrs. Siddons As The Tragic Muse Oil on canvas 1784,"cavetocanvas:  Jusepe de Ribera, St. Sebastian Tended by Holy Women, 1621","From the Paumgartner Altar: St. George (detail), Albrecht Durer, 1498","necspenecmetu:  Ludovico Lana, The Crucifixion, 17th century",nataliakoptseva:  Albrecht Durer  detail,"diagnosednostalgia:  Matthias Grunewald  Detail from the Isenheim Altarpiece, c. 1515","scrollofthoth:  Charles-Emile-Auguste Durand, Carolus-Duran (1837 - 1917) - Vision, 1883  Ave Babalon","necspenecmetu:  Gaetano Gandolfi, Venus in the Forge of Vulcan, c. 1770-5",Saint Margaret by Simon Vouet,"necspenecmetu:  Andrea Solario, Christ Carrying the Cross, c. 1505-15","jaded-mandarin:  Wallerant Vaillant.

And yet he pursued his idea of painting, anticipating things that would be deeply understood only many years later. Against all conventional rules, he used prostitutes as models for his Madonnas, he painted peasants praying the Holy Mary with their dirty nails and greasy hair, so that, for the very first time, people could recognize themselves in what they saw.

"endofmarch:  Sometimes I have this fleeting thought of I am good enough for this. Then it slips between my fingers, not quite merging with my skin, like water and oil, leaving only its faint scent under my fingernails, in the creases of my pillow.  One day, Ill find its freezing point, flash freeze it before it gets away and swallow it whole. Then it can melt inside my chest where it wont get away. Then Ill think it and think it and think it, on and on  and Ill believe it, too.","endofmarch:  He made me a blanket fort.  Last year, when I was going reckless with sadness and panic, wondering constantly as to what I am doing, what I am suppose to do, what I want and the sheer conviction that I could never achieve what I want to achieve, he made me a blanket fort.  He set it out at the foot of the bed, so I could lean my back against it. He put a small foam mattress on the floor and covered it with a soft duvet. He made it just high enough to sit in it and made sure all chairs, all wood, everything that wasnt soft and blankets and pillows, was covered. He put a lamp there, and my computer, and a fan for when it got too hot. And then, he let me in, and pulled down the covers behind me, so that it was only me there, safe, in my own cocoon.   I stayed in there for more than a week. Only coming out to go to the bathroom, or for food. I even slept there, and he never minded me not being with him in bed. I laid there watching all the episodes of Jeeves & Wooster, which proved almost as big a comfort as the fort itself, and movies and silly youtube videos. Sometimes he would crawl in with me, and hold me in his arms while we watched episodes of QI.  He never said anything. Never told me I should stop. Never told me to get over it, to get out of there already. So one day, I got out, looked around, and pulled down the fort myself, carefully folding all of the blankets, putting away the mattress and the chairs, putting back the computer where it belonged on the desk, sat there, and watched another movie.  And that was that.  He made me a blanket fort, so I wouldnt feel so lost, so I could feel safe, until I was able to stand on my own again.   (about my love xxx)",a letter to the end of summer.,my summer vacation. 2012,"endofmarch:  apparently it does not suffice to tuck yourself away in a suitcase    (and get your hair caught in the zipper and   chafe your skin against the leather and squeeze    your toes between   the socks and ugly underwear, and block   your ears, so they dont hear   the sharp, clear sound of the locks as they    close, with finality,   no,)   you have to carry it  too.","endofmarch:  Girls with oxford shoes; girls with tattoos on  their arms, like maps - the x marks the spot where treasure lies. Boys with red lips; Boys with large hands and square jaws and lovely treacherous eyes. Crouching down behind bookshelves in a store, having a panic attack and clutching at the spine of Great Expectations. The irony is never lost on anyone, unfortunately. Pages bruised and torn and sweaty fingertips on colourful covers, blinding with overwrought letters, cheerful comments - a classic; a masterpiece; a treasure for generations to come; forever the best.   Girls that know better; Boys that know too much. Poetry circles filled with cigarette smoke, fumbling touches against rock walls, backs arching like bows like arrows flying to jab at skin and paint with blood and moaning against the grass, against the stone, with bruises on pale hips and bite marks on shoulders. Girls with toothy grins; Boys with well-pressed trousers. And one more panic attack only witnessed by dead men, who knew nothing of the pain of carpet burns on bare knees.  (I dont know what that is, but Ive decided to keep it. Call it a writing exercise or something. I dont know)"

Date a girl who may never wear completely clean clothes, because of coffee stains and ink spills. Shell have many problems with her closet space, and her laptop is never boring because there are so many words, so many worlds that shes cluttered amidst the space. Tabs open filled with obscure and popular music. Interesting factoids about Catherine the Great, and the immortality of jellyfish. Laugh it off when she tells you that she forgot to clean her room, that her clothes are lost among the binders so itll take her longer to get ready, that her shoes hidden under the mountain of broken Bic pens and the refurbished laptop that shes saved for ever since she was twelve.   Kiss her under the lamppost, when its raining. Tell her your definition of love.   Find a girl who writes. Youll know that she has a sense of humor, a sense of empathy and kindness, and that she will dream up worlds, universes for you. Shes the one with the faintest of shadows underneath her eyelids, the one who smells of coffee and Coca-cola and jasmine green tea. You see that girl hunched over a notebook. Thats the writer. With her fingers occasionally smudged with charcoal, with ink that will travel onto your hands when you interlock your fingers with hers. She will never stop, churning out adventures, of traitors and heroes. Darkness and light. Fear and love. Thats the writer. She can never resist filling a blank page with words, whatever the color of the page is.  Shes the girl reading while waiting for her coffee and tea. Shes the quiet girl with her music turned up loud (or impossibly quiet), separating the two of you by an ocean of crescendos and decrescendos as shes thinking of the perfect words. If you take a peek at her cup, the tea or coffees already cold. Shes already forgotten it.  Use a pick-up line with her if she doesnt look to busy.  If she raises her head, offer to buy her another cup of coffee. Or of tea. Shell repay you with stories. If she closes her laptop, give her your critique of Tolstoy, and your best theories of Hannibal and the Crossing. Tell her your characters, your dreams, and ask if she gotten through her first novel.   It is hard to date a girl who writes. But be patient with her. Give her books for her birthday, pretty notebooks for Christmas and for anniversaries, moleskins and bookmarks and many, many books. Give her the gift of words, for writers are talkative people, and they are verbose in their thanks. Let her know that youre behind her every step of the way, for the lines between fiction and reality are fluid.  Shell give you a chance.  Dont lie to her. Shell understand the syntax behind your words. Shell be disappointed by your lies, but a girl who writes will understand. Shell understand that sometimes even the greatest heroes fail, and that happy endings take time, both in fiction and reality. Shes realistic. A girl who writes isnt impatient; she will understand your flaws. She will cherish them, because a girl who writes will understand plot. Shell understand that endings happen for better or for worst.  A girl who writes will not expect perfection from you. Her narratives are rich, her characters are multifaceted because of interesting flaws. Shell understand that a good book does not have perfect characters; villains and tragic flaws are the salt of books. Shell understand trouble, because it spices up her story. No author wants an invincible hero; the girl who writes will understand that you are only human.  Be her compatriot, be her darling, her love, her dream, her world.  If you find a girl who writes, keep her close. If you find her at two AM, typing furiously, the neon gaze of the light illuminating her furrowed forehead, place a blanket gently on her so that she does not catch a chill. Make her a pot of tea, and sit with her. You may lose her to her world for a few moments, but she will come back to you, brimming with treasure. You will believe in her every single time, the two of you illuminated only by the computer screen, but invincible in the darkness.  She is your Shahrazad. When you are afraid of the dark, she will guide you, her words turning into lanterns, turning into lights and stars and candles that will guide you through your darkest times. Shell be the one to save you.  Shell whisk you away on a hot air balloon, and you will be smitten with her. Shes mischievous, frisky, yet shes quiet and when she has to kill off a lovely character, when she cries, hold her and tell her that it will be alright.   You will propose to her. Maybe on a boat in the ocean, maybe in a little cottage in the Appalachian Mountains. Maybe in New York City. Maybe Chicago. Baltimore. Maybe outside her publishers office. Because shes radiant, wherever she goes. Maybe even outside of a cinema where the two of you kiss in the rain. Shell say that it is overused and clichd, but the glint in her eyes will tell you that she appreciates it all the same.  You will smile hard as she talks a mile a second, and your heart will skip a beat when she holds your hand and she will write stories of your lives together. Shell hold you close and whisper secrets into your ears. Shes lovely, remember that. Shes self made and shes brilliant. Her names for the children might be terrible, but youll be okay with that. A girl who writes will tell your children fantastical stories.  Because that is the best part about a girl who writes. She has imagination and she has courage, and it will be enough. Shell save you in the oceans of her dreams, and shell be your catharsis and your 11:11. Shell be your firebird and shell be your knight, and shell become your world, in the curve of her smile, in the hazel of her eye the half-dimple on her face, the words that are pouring out of her, a torrent, a wave, a crescendo - so many sensations that you will be left breathless by a girl who writes.  Maybe shes not the best at grammar, but that is okay.  Date a girl who writes because you deserve it. Shes witty, shes empathetic, enigmatic at times and shes lovely. Shes got the most colorful life. She may be living in NYC or she may be living in a small cottage. Date a girl who writes because a girl who writes reads.   A girl who writes will understand reality. Shell be infuriating at times, and maybe sometimes you will hate her. Sometimes she will hate you too. But a girl who writes understands human nature, and she will understand that you are weak. She will not leave on the Midnight Train the first moment that things go sour. She will understand that real life isnt like a story, because while she works in stories, she lives in reality.   Date a girl who writes.   Because there is nothing better then a girl who writes.  this is my favorite post on tumblr  I love writing so much but nobody will ever see me this way",gu-avajuice:    florels:  mihsty:  this deserves the millions of notes   so pretty  loveee this,hallelujahoran:  can i hire ed sheeran to write my english papers,teenagurh:   rosy & bubblegum blog   (click here then click promo to gain),youthfairy:  oh my god craving rn,hippist:  rosified:  galo-71:  Rolling stones altamont free concert 1969  oh my god  Actually this is a gathering of all my followers at my first meet and greet.

Our mind goes from thinking we have logic to joiealhrngerkdjshnvlkzjhdnsf. It kind of sneaks up on you. You get to see her, and all of a sudden you find yourself wanting to see her more, and youre not entirely too sure why. Just something about her makes you smile. You talk to her as much as you can. Or you at least try to anyways. But to be honest sometimes you find yourself at a loss for words. Its because shes gorgeous; you literally lose every thought in your mind. The only words youre thinking are wowthis girl and you WANT to tell her. But you know its not the right time, and youre worried youll just scare her off. We think that for a number of reasonsyou could have been hurt in the past by a guy and we dont want to be associated with him by a stereotype, you could not be interested in us and think were creepy, the usual stuff. Anyways, as you talk to her more and more and time passes by. Days. Weeks. Months. However long it takesyou find your days strange if you dont talk to her. Shes on your mind all the time. Everything from man I wish she was here to I cant get over how beautiful her eyes areI see them everytime I close mine. Then next thing you know youre with her, and your heart starts racing as you begin to get shaky. You dont want her to see your hand trembling, but in front of everybody you physically flirt a little to test the waters. And if she plays back you swallow everything and lightly go to take her hand. In front of every one. Your friends are cheering you on in their heads, but you can see it in their eyes. And then you look into hers just to see if shes just as nervous as you are..and at that point its fair to say youve fallen for a girl. Maybe not totally gone off the ledge, fallen in love. But shes definitely going to be almost every thought you have. And every moment youre not with her, youre going to wish you were. And if youre lucky enough to reach the point where she starts taking your hand first? Good luck son. Heart will be skipping beats. Pulse will be sky rocketing. Words may even stutter. I guess what Im getting at is, a girl is kind of like an addiction. Not in a bad way (most the time). But once one catches your attention you can never get enough of her. You want more. You want to see her more. You want to hold her more. And above all else you want her to smile morebecause all of those things, they give you a rush you just cant replace.

The consecration of the monument falls on the birthday of the Grand Duchess Olga Nicholayevna, who was born in 1895 [3 November Old Style).  The monument was consecrated by the Metropolitan Vincent of Tashkent and the Uzbek, who previously served as the Metropolitan of Ekaterinburg. He noted that the idea of creating a memorial to the children of Nicholas II came to him just weeks before he was transferred to a new place of ministry. The statue created by sculptor, Igor Akimov, said that his work was created based on photographs and portraits of the Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and the Tsarevich Alexei.  The height of the monument, Royal Children - stands nearly 3 meters, its weight - 2 tons. According to the sculptor of the monument, the children of Nicholas II descend from heaven on the inclined stone plinth, with crosses in their hands. They are huddled together and looking cautiously around. The expression on their innocent faces relates the fear they must have endured at the hands of their murderers.",losed:  Cody Rocko,"does coffee make you depressed  i look up,   as im drinking coffee,  depressed.","Only-begotten, Plutos honord wife,  O venerable Goddess, source of life: Tis thine in earths profundities to dwell, Fast by the wide and dismal gates of hell: Joves holy offspring, of a beauteous mien, Fatal, with lovely locks, infernal queen","1969 Moon Globe by Agent Gallery Chicago, issued to commemorate the lunar landing.",suicideblonde:  Diane Kruger photographed by Kate Berry,bohemea:  Marion Cotillard by Bruce Weber,"history meme. five assassinations: Julius Caesar, by Senators of Rome 15 MARCH 44BC. On the Ides of March, Julius Caesar entered the Senate. There he was stabbed to death by around forty senators, members of the ruling class and paragons of education and intellect in the society of Ancient Rome. Only twenty-one names of these conspirators, self-styled as The Liberators, survive history and nearly all of them staunchly defended the so-called sancitity of the Republic threatened, allegedly, by the quick rise to tyrannical power of Julius Caesar. However, the death of the tyrant had also led to the end of the Republic for which he was killed. Civil war broke out, with Mark Antony on one side and Octavian, Caesars legal heir, on the other. Eventually, Mark Antony fled to Egypt, where he would be defeated by Octavian. Octavian became Augustus, the first Emperor and founder of the Roman Empire, and ushered in the era of Pax Romana.",Goodness is something chosen.

It takes into account how hard the paper is each year, so if the entire populace does badly, they lower the grade boundaries to reflect difficulty. AND TRUST ME, IT CAN GET VERY DIFFICULT. This is referred to as Grade inflation (or deflation).  In certain subjects where grade boundaries appear low, its also to do with the fact that examiners are EXTREMELY stingy with awarding marks. In order to achieve just 1 mark (and take into consideration the time limit is usually set so that you have to work for a mark a MINUTE) you have to follow precise AOs, (assessment objectives) and with humanities subjects theres usually four different AOs with various levels of achievement. The likelihood of hitting all these AOs within the time given is next to none, but youre still pushed to do it. So actually, if the grade boundaries are low, you should be pretty fucking worried. Our qualifications, from A-Level upwards, are very, very specialised. Whereas in the US system you go on to major and minor to create a well-rounded curriculum we are made to pick one certain field of interest and study in (a fuckload of) depth. The grade system and the huge levels of scrutiny in examboards reflects the amount you are suppose to know for one particular subject. (and when I say how much Im talking the precise grain production levels of all the 5-year plans during Stalinist Russia, for fucking example)  Sincerely, a British student who has to continually listen to privately educated politicians use these exact standards of over-simplification to justify their demonisation of the English, Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish state school system.  fucking thank you",hamburgay:  send me my url and ill tell you how perfect i am,"le-jolie:  My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56.

They push the human race forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

She loves him and she recognises hes great at fooling around, but women like stability and some men can provide that and some men cant.  I think thats more and more a modern problem, people getting longer in the tooth and still not settling down or having kids or you know, people living at home until they are 30. That does have an effect on society, I suppose.  In real life Murphy has long been married to installation artist Yvonne McGuinness and is a highly devoted husband and father to two sons. What made it work for him when so many actors have trouble settling down?  Ive always wanted that, he responds. I was always into the homestead, somewhere to go back to, some solidity, maybe because I was brought up that way.  But I also think its because as actors we are going around the place and constantly creating close relationships and then youre gone again. So to have a space and somewhere that you can just be you is essential. Some actors are on all the time and I cant be like that. I find it hard being on briefly!  Understandably, this down-to-earth Irishman takes the notion of celebrity with a grain of salt. I remember the old days when you didnt have to be a personality and funny on TV and a model and on Twitter. You could just be an actor and thats all I want to be.  Certainly Murphy has never been seduced by Hollywood. He considers himself a European actor and is content with his life.  I love going over to America and making films occasionally. I like the absurdity of LA, but I never want to force it on my family.","Cillian Murphy shows up looking like hes in disguise.

And what better way to get people motivated than a little good-humoured contest?  GUIDELINES: -Write a story that revolves around Scarey Quinn. As this is the first contest, anything goes, so write what you fancy writing about whether that be romance, angst, friendship etc..  -Stories can be based around the characters in the comic world, film world or even the Batman games so use your imagination and lets see how much diversity we can get! -Fics must be submitted BEFORE the 16th of November as thats the last day I will be able to read them before announcing the winner on the 17th.  -While I would prefer that stories were hosted on fanfiction.net (or the ~adult version), it is not a requirement. -You must write a new story for this contest, rather than link to an old story. -Fics can be as long as short as you like but the final chapter must be up by the final deadline to be included in the contest and I must be kept informed about additions. -It goes without saying really but stories MUST BE YOUR OWN - naming and shaming will happen to thieves.   PRIZES: -I will choose one overall winner who will recieve the following: a 500x525px advert/banner for their fic; a 500x600px graphic based on their story or an element from it; a playlist (with accompanying graphic); and will be able to pick the prompt or theme for the next contest. -I will also pick three honourable mentions; one based on the comic book versions of the characters, one on the movie version and one on the game versions (dependent on whether each section is filled). They will each win a 500x525px advert for their story. -Every entry will be listed on this blogs fanfiction page and thus will have a smaller banner made for their story. Depending on how many people enter, they may be rolled out in stages.  Thats all so get writing and good luck! Guys! Just a couple of days to get your fics in!","Yeaaaaah so someone reposted my graphic without credit.  Not cool, bro. Not cool.

New releases & old favorites will be posted. Recommendations for October will be gathered. Erotica will probably be read.

We will also be encouraging a more solid level of participation so that all of us Bad Bitches can get our read on & talk about it among ourselves.

Do you think Beauty enjoyed her punishments at the Queens Court? Would you?  2. Explain in your own words why Beauty tried to escape? Do you believe she was trying to escape from the Queen or test the limits of what she could experience while in the Queens kingdom?  3. Would you rather be in the position of a slave or a member of the Court?  4. The sexual scenes within the story are described graphically. Do you think this enhances the readers perception of the world that Anne Rice is trying to create, or that it is too much?  5. Speculate on why the Prince was so enamored with Beauty.  6. How do you feel about the narrative structure of this story (shifting in perspectives from the Prince to Beauty once she awakens)? Would you have preferred it written differently?  7. What was your favorite scene (i.e., Beautys first introduction to the court, Alexis punishment by the Prince, the Bridle Path)?  8. Submissive/Dominant roles are used in tandem with sexual acts to train the slaves to be obedient, humble, & more efficient rulers. After their training, they are returned to their respective kingdoms allegedly improved by their experiences. Do you think this kind of training has the potential to affect a persons overall behavior? Would you want to engage in it?  9. Which of Beautys partners (i.e., the Prince, Alexi, Lady Juliana, the Queen, etc.) did you like the best? Of these, which would you want to have as your Master/Mistress?  10. Though the Tributes are used as slaves in potentially humiliating acts, they are thoroughly cleaned & pampered after each use. The phrase cleanliness is next to godliness comes to mind: do you think that the slaves, although used for the Courts entertainment, are possibly worshiped as gods & goddesses themselves? Explain.

XOXO","vivelareine:    [This interview has also been published on my book blog Reading Treasure.]  Im very excited to share my recent interview with Bianca Turetsky, author of The Time-Traveling Fashionista series and its newest entry, The Time-Traveling Fashionista at the Palace of Marie Antoinette. If you havent heard of the series yet: It follows the adventures the young and vintage-loving Louise Lambert, who receives a mysterious invitation vintage fashion sale and, upon trying on unique vintage wear, finds herself transported back in time. The first novel sent Louise on the historic and fateful first voyage of the Titanic in 1912the newest and second novel will find Louise in the distant 18th century, in the glittering but also doomed world of Marie Antoinette. The second novel is set to be released on September 18th and can be pre-ordered from retailers such as Amazon.com.    Q. What was your inspiration for the first Time Traveling Fashionista book? And did you always plan for the story to be a series?  A. The idea came to me a few years ago after visiting this amazing vintage shop in New Haven CT, called Fashionista Vintage and Variety. Its owned by these two fabulous women, Todd and Nancy, who know everything and anything about vintage clothing. I tried on this pink party dress that belonged to a Mrs. Baxter from Newport Rhode Island, and I couldnt help but wonder what her life was like, what the last gala or fancy event was that she wore this to. Was she in love? Was she happy? And how in a way, her memory was being preserved through this garment.  I had always hoped it would be a series, as there are so many historical events to explore and people who would be fun for my character Louise to meet through their dresses!  Q. This second story takes Louise all the way back to 18th century France. What kind of research did you do on the time period and what would you say was the most difficult part of putting Louise in that historical setting?  A. Doing the research for this book was so much fun. My grandmother, who immediately volunteered to be my research assistant, and I went on a trip to Paris! We took the train out to the palace of Versailles to see what it is actually like in person. Its really hard to appreciate the scale and grandeur of the place from photographs- although I hope I was able to capture it in this story. We ate lots of French pastries (for research purposes of course!) and wandered around the grounds and gardens where Marie Antoinette lived hundreds of years ago.  The most difficult part was trying to be as historically accurate as possible. The books are fun, but through them I also want to get girls excited about history by teaching it in this new way- through the fashion of the times.  Q. Could you tell us a little about what inspired you to pick that particular time period?  A. After watching Sofia Coppolas movie, Marie Antoinette, which was such a visual treat, I became obsessed with the fashion and food and aesthetic of that time period. And Marie Antoinette herself is such an iconic historical figure that I thought it would be fun to research more about who she actually was as a person. She was really just a girl when she was thrown into such responsibility. I thought my readers, many of who are just a few years younger than she was when she was taken from her home and married into the French royal family, would be able to relate to her in a different, more intimate way.  Q. Fashion, obviously, plays a big part in the books. How would you compare the fashion of Marie Antoinettes court with the fashion of the well-do-to during the early 1910s? Do you personally have a favorite 18th century fashion style?  A. The fashion of the 1910s was constricting, but it had nothing on the heavy, corseted frocks of Marie Antoinettes court. The gowns were so complicated and intricate that it would take a whole gaggle of ladies in waiting to help her get dressed each day. I think Id prefer to wear the more casual (and definitely more comfortable) muslin tea dresses that she introduced when she was spending more time at Petit Trianon.  And finally: The first novel definitely had a theres no place like home feel to it. Is there a special message you hope to convey to readers in the second book?  A. The second book has a bit of that theres no place like home and be careful what you wish for sentiment as well. I feel like when youre 12 (or at least when I was!) you want to be living in another more fabulous life with hair that never frizzes, a less embarrassing set of parents, and a fabulous closet full of clothes. Of course I still feel that longing sometimes, but Ive grown to feel more comfortable in my own skin and appreciate my real life more as I get older. Louise is still learning that!    Id like to thank Bianca Turetsky for taking the time to answer my questions and many thanks to Lisa Moraleda, (Associate Director of Publicity at Little, Brown Books for Young Readers) for helping me set this interview up!  OOH I LIKE THIS ~Aimee","August 2012s Book of the Month: THE CLAIMING OF SLEEPING BEAUTY by A.N. Roquelaure (Anne Rice)  In the traditional folktale of Sleeping Beauty, the spell cast upon the lovely young princess and everyone in her castle can only be broken by the kiss of a Prince. It is an ancient story, one that originally emerged from and still deeply disturbs the minds unconscious. Now Anne Rices retelling of the Beauty story probes the unspoken implications of this lush, suggestive tale by exploring its undeniable connection to sexual desire. Here the Prince reawakens Beauty, not with a kiss, but with sexual initiation. His reward for ending the hundred years of enchantment is Beautys complete and total enslavement to him as Anne Rice explores the world of erotic yearning and fantasy in a classic that becomes, with her skillful pen, a compelling experience.  Hey Bitches, heres the book for August! Well be reading the first book in this trilogy by Anne Rice, but dont be afraid to get ahead of yourself & read all three! All the admins put in suggestions this month, but we still have yet to hear from YOU, our members.

If you have not finished the book, the admins STRONGLY urge you to wait until you do to look through the questions. They will remain posted indefinitely.   <!-- more -->1. How did you feel about The Night Circus being written from a third-person omniscient perspective? Did the various viewpoints & time shifts throw you off, or do you feel as if they complimented the nature of the circus itself?  2. Which tent would you most like to visit in the circus? Do you think you would be able to explore, or would you get particularly enthralled by one performer?  3. The novel begins with the quote: A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, & his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world? Does this quote explain anyone in particular in the novel? A group of people? Who is a dreamer & what is their punishment for being so?  4. Celia & Marco are trained with different methods: Celia is given a more hands-on approach, while Marco studies the actual theory before practice. Which one, if either, is more effective? Which method would you rather study?  5. Would you want to be a performer in the circus? What would your talent be?  6. Do you think there is a certain morality in the circus? Should Marco & Celia have enlightened some of their fellow employers about their competition, or could that have negatively affected the outcome/those involved?  7. What does Bailey symbolize to you? Why did he give himself to the circus?  8. How does Isobel compare/contrast to Celia? Does Marco have a foil - if so, explain who & why.  9. How does time play a significance in the goings on of the circus, including its affects on the performers? Does Friederick Thiessens clock contribute in some way to the distortion, or is it merely a pawn of the circus?  10. Explain the role of Tsukiko in your own words. Do you feel as though she is heavily influenced by the circus, thus making her a pawn, or is she an outside contributor whose gifts occasionally follow the sway?","JULY 15 > JULY 20  Hello bitches!

If you have any concerns, feel free to message us!  XOXO",svetlana-del-rey:  Stoyas Book Club  I thought my fellow bitches would like this.,"arseniccupcakes:    spicyobsession:  In an effort to eradicate the myth of the seductive/sexually-empowered slave mistress (most recently perpetuated by Tour on Twitter, apparently), new novelist Dolen Perkins-Valdez has penned a work of historical fiction set in a real location: Tawawa House, a summer resort that catered to white slaveholders and their enslaved lovers, in the free state of Ohio.  Wench chronicles the lives of four slave women: Mawu, Sweet, Reenie, and Lizzie (the central protagonist) whose masters annually whisk them away from the hardship of their plantation lives and put them up in cottages for a few weeks in summer.  For the women, few things have changed, other than their location: theyre still monitored, chained on a whim, and systematically raped. Only now, theyre also given once-lovely ball gownsyears-old cast-offs left behind by the resorts previous white patronsand encouraged to doll themselves up for a semi-public dinner and dance.  Theyre also allowed the occasional free day, an irony, of course, on two fronts: they still must cook and clean, while their masters are away from the resort fishing, and also, as they spend hours of spare time trekking through the woods, where they meet abolitionists and happen upon an adjacent resort for free Blacks, they are constantly reminded of the vicious slave-catchers who lie in wait, at the first sign of any escape attempts.  The four women featured are from plantations in different states, and the circumstances of their relationships with their masters drastically vary. Three of the four hold their masters in varying degrees of contempt, with Mawu being the most hateful and determined. Lizzies the holdout: she earnestly believes that she and her master are in love.  Lizzies is the central story; shes the only one of the characters whose post-summer life were shown. She and her master have two children. Over the course of their decade-long relationship (which began when she was just thirteen), she experiences highs (shes given the guest room across the hall from the masters barren wife) and lows (toward the end of the novel, shes tied to the cottage porch at Tawawa House, while recovering from a very significant illness). We watch her illusions about the ability for love to exist between master and slave dissolve, with each passing summer at the resort. And, despite the tragic losses all four women experience, Lizzies mental/emotional negotiations and denials are perhaps the saddest of all.  The novel is a fast-paced read, with each of the four main women fully rendered as sympathetic and alive. Most interesting of all: by the end, you begin to realize that the book isnt as much an examination of the relationship of master to slavewoman as it is a loving meditation on the bonds between women forced into the slave mistress role. The central four are steadfast friends, willing to forgive even the most egregious betrayals, because the understand the complexity of this life: hated by house and field slaves alike, yet relied upon to post-coitally plead those slaves causes.  Theres an unspoken devotion between them that drives the plot and informs a seldom-examined facet of history. Theres no way you could walk away from it, believing an enslaved woman has any real agency in a relationship with her enslaver. Maybe Tour should give it a gander.  THIS JUST JUMPED TO THE TOP OF MY READING LIST  BITCHES LOOK AT THIS","Dear Bitches,  This is your admin HANNAH speaking. Id just like to clear up a few misconceptions about the book club that have been brought to my attention, & to apologize for the absolutely bonkers schedule that was last month.  First, the issues:  The BBBC is a free, non-discriminatory, open club for people of all types to ENJOY READING. We promote healthy discussion between all members, regardless of rank in the club & encourage conversation - both focused on the BotM & on personal levels. If you, as a member, EVER feel the need to talk on a more private level with one of the admins, simply message this Tumblr & request to talk to us & we will be MORE THAN HAPPY to help you out. YOU DONT HAVE TO READ THE BOOK. I cannot stress this enough. Yes, this is a BOOK CLUB & we READ BOOKS - but this club was created by five working-class girls in their early 20s that understand what its like to have: medical issues, lack of finances, school schedules, work schedules, social lives, & otherwise prior engagements that cannot afford you the time to read a book. Its okay. Just know that if you dont read the book, you obviously cannot participate in the discussion. Which is okay - we dont hold that against you. If you read Mays BotM five months from now, go ahead & get in on that discussion. The mods receive notifications when you comment on a thread, & will be happy to reignite the discussion with you! If you want to join, join! Thats it. You dont have to follow this blog, you dont have to have a Tumblr, you dont have to be friends with me or any of the other mods. If you want to be a Bad Bitch, then BE ONE. There is a certain level of participation that is expected from members: the admins expect you to read a book (if you are unable to, see above), give book suggestions, & participate in discussion. Or, at the very least, MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN. This blog has 11 followers: I am personally unaware of any participating members other than myself & the four other mods. Which is okay! But if you do want to be a member, at least message us & say Hey, this is me, Id like to join. & youre in, done deal. On to the apology:  Im sorry for the awful posting schedule that dominated June. I was recently promoted at my job & had been going through training hours. On top of that, Ive had to deal with financial issues in relation to my husbands occupation, & some recent medical problems (nothing serious, but enough to hinder my day-to-day activity). I was scheduled to work the day of discussion, hence the EXTREMELY LATE posting of the questions. But, as stated in every pre-discussion post: you can post your responses in the thread WHENEVER YOU LIKE.  This month will DEFINITELY be on track with posts & updates, & I hope that I never disappoint you guys again.  Your Loving Bitch, Hannah","July 2012s Book of the Month: THE NIGHT CIRCUS by ERIN MORGENSTERN  The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rves, and it is only open at night.   But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underwaya duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into lovea deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.    True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. Hellooo Bitches! This is our book of the month for July! Wed like to make it clear here at the Bad Bitch Book Club that ALL MEMBERS - moderator or otherwise - are allowed to send in suggestions (maximum of 3) for the Book of the Month.

I will never be like to my kids as you are to me. its disgusting. you cant just change from taking a back seat my whole life to now being on my back every second of the day.   life is about personal achievement, and what ive achieved so far is enough for me. so take your bullshit and shove it down your other childrens throats.   i can hear my parents arguing and everything is just fucking braw.   i want out."
